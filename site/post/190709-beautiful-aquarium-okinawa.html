<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Like yesterday, I asked a staff of the monorail station, and went to the Naha Bus Terminal, at Asahibashi [旭橋].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had to get on the bus “117” to go to the Beautiful Aquarium [美 ら 海水族館].</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a good 2- hour drive to the Aquarium;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I didn’t know it was that far.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Though having slept little, I couldn’t fall asleep on the bumpy highway.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By Nago City perhaps, the bus emerged out of weeds and tombs,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and afterwards it followed the highway by the seashore.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had plenty time watching in solitude the sea, which extended to the unfathomable skyline in loneliness, and brooding about what misery the mankind was in, and completing the boring writing which this travel journal was.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One got off “in front of the Memorial Park” [記念公園前], which was exactly the entrance of the Ocean Expo Park.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was moderately hot, but quite humid in the air.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Following the brochures, one walked for some 5 minutes to the right to enter the Aquarium.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a shark statue in front of the door, which I would soon realize what it stand for.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With the 1850 yen ticket, one got into the building crowded with people;</span> <span class="serif-roman">some were speaking Mandarin,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and some were downright excited kids.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the first room one could touch the sea stars and sea urchins, if done gently.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a big fish tank made with magnifying glass- wall, so that a variety of fish could be closely examined.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A swirling school of clownfish (to which people exclaim “Nemo”, referring to «Finding Nemo»), a really huge and scary grey sweetlips, a trumpetfish like a stick, and sea turtles which whipped its limbs to surface upwards—</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a myriad of creatures I could not name.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These seemingly meaningless encyclopedia entries had, at that moment, turned into vivid bone and flesh in front of me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How alienated have we been from the real nature surrounding us?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We were not far from thinking the sushi bar menu is a close likeness to the fish.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I thought that that was it, I was wrong;</span> <span class="serif-roman">what was in the next room was nothing less than any of these.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now there was a tank, in which a ray with funny protruding eyes pressed the glass— not that.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A still larger, incredibly large fish, as wide as several adult’s height, swam casually across the curved glass wall, near the surface of water.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Everyone exclaimed in earnest awe in their language.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a whale shark.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now I just laughed at myself for just having considered those sea basses to be large.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A dented canopy enabled us to directly look, under it, the whale sharks from below,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so I could examine its fins and abdomen closely, in a frightening angle.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">At 1 and half, a diver went into the tank to shot real- time video of these sea creatures, which was showed on a screen.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Not in their natural home, they required great care by the staff.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We were still not sure what they eat, the written notes said.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The staff even had the female whale sharks taken the ultrasound scan— with help by Taiwanese researchers— when it was about to give birth to baby sharks.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nevertheless, they must find the tank (or perhaps the bowl) to be depressingly small, barely possible to let them turn around as recklessly as in the ocean, though the tank had been recognized officially as the largest fish tank in the world.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What would the whale sharks be like if they were able to go back to the sea?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They were to plunge merrily, perhaps, once they felt like it, towards the deepest sea, into the pure blackness which the mankind perceived to be mere endless void, and again to rise onto the surface of water in no time.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Beside the tank for the whale sharks, there were miscellaneous tanks inhabiting other deep sea creatures.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That was made possible by specially designed device which exerted extra pressure, as explained on a plaque.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The lobsters were big as an adult’s chest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The jellyfish, glowing under the ultraviolet light, were eating something eerily while wielding its tentacles.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And the flashlightfish in the darkness could only be recognized by its distinctive fluorescent stripe.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the souvenir store I bought a shirt with the iconic whale shark on it, hoping that the trifle amount of money would help them keep living at their ease.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thinking it was possible to go into the Aquarium again, I felt like that was enough for the moment, and followed my whim to visit the plant gardens pictured on the brochure.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Beside the Aquarium building, there were several pools for manatees and sea turtles.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A dolphin show, as I passed by, had just ended.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Southwards were more butterflies and bees, and tropical plants with prickling leaves,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and crow caw could be heard.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The plant garden didn’t seem to be as impressive as the Aquarium was.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But fearing that the bus time might be unpredictable, I decided, by almost 4 o’clock, that I go back to wait for the returning bus.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The bus soon came,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I called it a day.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By now I had had nothing impressive, except an Onigiri bought in the morning by the Naha terminal station, and a shabby soba- noodle in a stand by the Aquarium,</span> <span class="serif-roman">So I was really hungry.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">After going back to the hotel and having rested for a moment, it was already 8 o’clock,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and what was still opening might only be Izakaya- bars.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I have never been to a Izakaya- bar;</span> <span class="serif-roman">speaking of that, this area, reading Maejima [前島] on the map, seemed right at the center of an aggregation of Izakaya- bars;</span> <span class="serif-roman">there were more than a dozen within walking distance.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I crossed a street to go into the nearest one, “海 の ち ん ぼ ら ぁ”, judging from the 4- star rating on Google Maps.</span></span>

<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The staff welcomed me to a low wooden seat, near the bar adorned with seashells;</span> <span class="serif-roman">there, through the glass around the open kitchen, fish slices could be seen, on which diligently working cooks worked in front of me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ordered a dish of rice fried with fish shreds and served with sea urchin.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Orion Beer could be refilled free, as seemed to be the norm.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Quickly I realized it was a tad weird that I was typing alone here, since I could tell from the surrounding that the place served usually for gatherings of business people and friends alike.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I tried not to be embarrassed, and ordered another soy- sauce- stewed fish,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it certainly tasted like one of the best stewed fish I had ever had, cooked just to the right point, rightly contrasting the bitter but smooth flavored Orion beer.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Later that day I would leave a 5- star rating for the inconspicuous bar;</span> <span class="serif-roman">I told the cook that, not sure whether they could understand English.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">At least, the fish alone cost some 1400 yen,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and this number ought to be forgotten.</span></span>
