<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The protagonist was aware that his uncle Xitai, his motherâ€™s eldest brother, had cancer, only after it was getting serious.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The ominous but commonplace fact gradually sank into his cognitive capacity, by the time it was mentioned two or three times, starting from a worried call by his mother in perhaps June and several others, concluding with an announcement that he was admitted into palliative care.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Uncle and his family live in the US, and he have only seen him twice,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Hence he didnâ€™t feel much sadness, but there was emptiness which emerges every time he know people was dying.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mother didnâ€™t appear to be weeping, and he didnâ€™t bring up the matter.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And he could only imagine how sad Xitaiâ€™s wife was, from the broken English she wrote in Line (even having stayed in the US for decades) to repeatedly ask the Lord for his blessing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was a medical doctor, and was attentive of his health;</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was frugal with money and hard working.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then still he got ill, suddenly due to a recurring of cancer, about one month just before he retired, deprived of the chance to enjoy his remaining days.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was drinking only cokes and locked himself in his room.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Maybe because he could research about his own survival curve.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Was it a coincidence that he was reading *Simply Nietzsche* by Peter Kail?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In Â«The Birth of TragedyÂ», the book explained, Nietzsche was answering the pessimism of Schopenhauerâ€™s,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And according to Schopenhauer, our life is essentially no more than a never- ending but meaningless suffering.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nietzsche so respondedâ€” it continuedâ€” that it is only through the intoxication in art that we could unite as a whole, finding the power to overcome the bleak reality in so doing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How terrifying it would be, he imagined, to face death, such that many who in their last functional phase converted from atheists to believers, even intelligent ones including Einstein and Grothendieck.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What precisely changed them?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(He once spent some time reading a post on Reddit which asked believers who converted from atheists, what the reason was;</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He read the whole thing,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And that didnâ€™t make him any more emphatic with them.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He knew it, that religion helps people cope with their short and brutal life.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But how was they persuaded that what they yearn for exists, when they genuinely yearn for it?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The next day he went to Gongguan as usual, and walked into the Campus Bookstore the first time it finished remodeling;</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Affiliation to the church, the building was just across the street from the university.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One of the displayed book was Â«The Reason for GodÂ» by Timothy Keller,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And he recalled Isaac the chess player, in one of his apologetic posts, had shared some quotes by Keller.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He picked it up and skimmed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Since we have a natural tendency to crave for something more than the material world, doesnâ€™t it hint that the immaterial realm may actually exist?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Enough, he put it down and went upstairs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was here that once Celia pressed him to join a gathering, and he wouldnâ€™t, which led to countless arguments.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now there were much fewer books, with those classic translated novel disappearing except certainly the bibles, leaving a more hollow second floor.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Just that night, the protagonist heard furthermore that Uncle was dying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People died, and he would die too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Why do we believe that our life was valuable, that we had to help people, and that we are not merely dust when we are gone?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As long as these are one of the overwhelming possibilities, which makes us feel better?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This is just optimism in extreme.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Many accept it, and it is hard to blame.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But not him.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He must himself face the loneliness, depression, anxiety, emptiness, sickness, and deathâ€” what life had yet really offered, but would certainly offer, in abundance.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People died together, and he must die alone.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Except perhaps with the companion of the beauty of music works, Schopenhauer and Nietzsche would have claimed in facing the dilemma, and the sense of connection he feel in creating them, so that he shall linger a little longer on the land of earth, however evanescent it is as it dies in the air, dissolving already into nothingness.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Some 6 hours later, as he woke up, Father read the messages and announced that Uncle had passed away.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was 74, not at all old to modern eyes.</span></span>
