<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The 2021 Tokyo Olympics having just ended reminds me of a scene in «From Up on Poppy Hill», where in the background there is a poster of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Last September when Ghibli studio released numerous screenshots from their films, this scene was one of them.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By then Japan had just postponed the Olympics, and was still unsure whether it should be cancelled;</span> <span class="serif-roman">hence, the scene was added sarcastic subtitles by dissenters, along the lines of “Break a leg in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics!”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But at least it informed me of the fact that Tokyo had held the Olympics once, and urged me to watch «From Up on Poppy Hill», a lesser known Ghibli opus, on Netflix.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It turns out the reference to the 1964 Olympics is strangely relevant, both in the film and in reality.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Umi Matsuzaki, a high school student, works at her family’s own boarding house by the Port of Yokohama.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Her father Yuichiro died in the Korean War,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but every morning, as a personal ritual, she raises a signal flag used to pray for a safe voyage.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The flag draws the attention of Shun Kazama, another high school student nearby,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he writes a poem in the school newspaper.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Umi and Shun are then acquainted,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and their mutual affection grows.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, when Umi shows Shun a photo, which Yuichiro is in, Shun recalls he has seen a duplicate photo from his adoptive father, Akio.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Shun thinks that he and Umi are siblings,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he refrains from meeting her.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Umi confronts Shun for the matter,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and on believing that they are siblings, she says she will still love him.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Actually, the situation is more convoluted.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Shun’s mother died in giving birth,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Shun’s father was also killed in the World War.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Shun was therefore given to Yuichiro;</span> <span class="serif-roman">since Yuichiro was unable to raise him either, he was in turn given to Akio.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Captain Yoshio, who is in the old photo too and knows Yuichiro, meets Umi and Shun;</span> <span class="serif-roman">he tells them of the history, and confirms that they aren’t siblings.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There is another subordinate plot, that an antique building Latin Quarter, used by student clubs, is to be demolished.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Shun and Umi, unwilling to see the building torn down, take a train to Tokyo to see a chair of the school;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it is here the screenshot takes place.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">After the building is remodelled by volunteering students, the chair decides not to demolish Latin Quarter.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">With both suspensions resolved, one would think a happy ending follows;</span> <span class="serif-roman">but Umi and Shun only stare stiffly at the reflection of twilight on the surface of water, not showing whether they will continue their relationship.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Another day begins,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Umi again raises the flag, as if waiting for her father who is never coming back.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A melancholy theme song is played for the credit roll,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and only emptiness remains.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The message of the film is, to me, whether sinners could find happiness; whether modern thinking Shun advocates in the club is compatible with the historic building, and whether Umi and Shun from the younger generation may take delight in their romance, in the aftermath of the war declared by the older.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Japan lost the world war, and wanted to prove its reform in the 1964 Olympic;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it underwent the financial crisis, and sought to show its power in the 2021 Olympic.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This is what Japan, a rather odd country, has been dealing with for decades.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is a place where politicians are seen wearing western suits in the arena, but sing the anthem Kimigayo in praise of their emperor in the opening ceremony;</span> <span class="serif-roman">it is a land of conservatism and confucianism, but also where Yoshiro Mori, President of the Olympics-organizing committee, was pressured to resign due to his remark that he was reluctant to increase the female board members.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The heart of the question is if human beings are capable of forgiving or not.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Japan and Germany killed people, as did Kuomintang.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nowadays (I believe) very few, if at all, would deem that acceptable,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it must be distressing for their descendants to hear the world repeatedly reprimand the horrible deed by the deceased generation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But what repentance is true?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What forgiveness is real?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If repentance can buy forgiveness, why not sin?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And if it doesn’t, what use is it?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We know we have sinned,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and still we sin;</span> <span class="serif-roman">we ask to be forgiven,</span> <span class="serif-roman">yet we don’t forgive.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Human beings are petty, intolerant, selfish, and impulsive,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and all we have is hope.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Hope is a flag on the hill, which we expect some sailor to see, but fails to be seen,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we wait and wait, until the sun sets, until we raise it the next day, waiting for all our live to be understood, to be loved, for the end of war, for the end of pandemic, even if our hair has been gray, our teeth shaking, and if in our last breath nobody is coming, which we never will realize.</span></span>
