<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There is the long held notion that truly creative achievements, for example a great breakthrough in mathematics, can only be done by young people —- which for brevity let us call the *youth-only view*.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The youth-only view is perhaps most famously expressed in Hardy’s *Apology of a Mathematician*, where he wrote, “No mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man’s game.”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In addition, the play *Proof*, which I enjoy very much, connects mathematics genius not only to the young age, but also to madness, agreeing and strengthening the perception of general public.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Out of curiosity I looked up Google Scholar a little, and there are both studies supporting and opposing the youth-only view.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I do not plan to write a survey, nor spend more time settling this matter, but I shall share my guess, though quite without empirical evidence.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For concreteness let us focus on mathematics, but I believe the same can be said of other profession that requires immense creativity.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Obviously mathematics requires concentration, memory, association, and they may have something to do with physical health too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Physical health usually declines gradually with age, for obviously reasons, but I do not think that it’s like that once you are past 40 you are doomed, unable to do anything significant ever like before.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is not a step function.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Even if some calculation takes a 20 year old 1 hour, but takes a 60 years old 2 hours, the 60 year old can still do it albeit taking more time, once his or her mental faculty is intact.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is far from that elder people can’t do any decent research.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Second, it may be just that middle aged people have more obligations than young people have, and these distract them from doing research.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Recall that, until change in social norm (indeed very recently), only men, not women, were allowed to pursue an academic career.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, men were in general responsible for family income.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They may be forced, then, to turn to something more profitable.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This, too, may be somehow related to the impression that young people are more willing to consider harder problems by taking risks.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Furthermore, full time professors may be occupied with administrative tasks and teaching responsibilities, making it more difficult to attack harder problems.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In short, this is my take on the youth-only view.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The old age may somehow reduce creative productivity, but only quantitatively rather than qualitatively, and social and family obligations may be a distraction (if not restriction) too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What we should keep in mind, though, is that youthful vigor will not forever be with us, and time is precious and we should spend it wisely.</span></span>
