<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In September 2018, Michael Atiyah, renowned mathematician and Fields Medal winner, claimed that he had simple proof of the Riemann Hypothesis.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Atiyah said, in an interview with New Scientist,</span> <span class="serif-roman">“Nobody believes any proof of the Riemann Hypothesis,</span> <span class="serif-roman">let alone a proof by someone who’s 90.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People say ‘we know mathematicians do all their best work before they’re 40’.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I’m trying to show them that they’re wrong.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That I can do something when I’m 90.”</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I searched about him,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it was said on Math Overflow that he had published some crackpot papers, like a shortened proof of Feit- Thompson theorem and nonexistence of complex 6- sphere.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(Although, to be honest, the first time I heard of Atiyah was the reference to Atiyah- Singer index theorem in «Not Even Wrong» by Peter Woit.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I saw the whole video,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I wasn’t prepared for this.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This wasn’t only crackpot,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but it verged on insanity.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Atiyah talked for about an hour,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but there was only one slide which was relatively substantial,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and most of it didn’t make sense.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The audience was silent when Atiyah finished talking and asked them whether they had questions.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Atiyah died in January 2019, 4 months later the speech,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he probably died thinking he had resolved a problem even greater than the index theorem.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There is the long held notion that truly substantial creation in mathematics can only be done by young people.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This, for brevity, let us call the “juvenile thesis”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The view is most famously expressed in «Apology of a Mathematician» by Hardy, where he wrote, “No mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man’s game.”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In addition, the play «Proof» (and its film adaptation), which I value highly, connects mathematics genius not only to the young age, but also to madness, strengthening the perception of the general public.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Out of curiosity I attempted to look up relevant studies supporting and opposing the “juvenile thesis”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It appears there are few decisive quantitative researches,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the question does look too broad to settle.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I am not able to write a survey,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but I can share my guess in possible underlying reasons.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Obviously mathematics requires concentration, memory, association, and more,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and hence they definitely have something to do with physical health, which declines gradually with age.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But the “juvenile thesis” seems to have mistaken quantity with quality.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That is to say, people put it the way that once you are past 40 you are doomed, and you are never going to do any decent research ever.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This is absurd:</span> <span class="serif-roman">the journey of life isn’t a step function.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">If some calculation takes a 20- year- old 5 minute, it might take a 60- year- old 15 minute,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the 60- year- old can still do it, once his or her mental faculty is intact.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The same, I believe, can be said of other creative professions.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Or it may just be that middle aged people have more obligations than young people have,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and these distract them from their research.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Until the recent change in social norm, only men, not women, were allowed to pursue an academic career.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Without saying, female mathematicians like Sofya Kovalevskaya and Emmy Noether obviously underwent lots of pressure.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(The reader may want to read ‹Too Much Happiness› by Alice Munro for Kovalevskaya’s story.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, men were thought to be responsible for family income.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Male mathematicians who didn’t made progress in their research for some time, may be forced to turn to something more profitable.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Therefore, both women and men in their middle age had been under immense social pressure that discouraged them from undertaking creative work without much compensation, like mathematics.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This further agrees the impression (as Hardy would have said) that young people are more willing to take risks by considering difficult fields of research.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Furthermore, full time professors are sometimes occupied with administrative tasks and teaching, making it more daunting to attack tough problems.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">So this is my take on the “juvenile thesis”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The old age may somehow reduce creativity, but only quantitatively rather than qualitatively.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Social and family obligations too may be a distraction, if not a restriction.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We should keep in mind, though, that youthful vigor won’t forever be with us, and every day should be spent wisely.</span></span>
