<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By the monorail, it took about 10 minutes to go from the Miebashi Station to the Shuri Station (首里駅), and then one walked for another 10 minute to the Shuri Castle (首里城).</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was free to enter the park of World Heritage, including going into part of the castle.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The route of visit was well planned, and one followed the arrow on the pervasive signs to go into Kankaimon-gate (歓会門) first.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The stone walls that surrounded the castle, and the stairsteps too, were built of hexagon stone bricks, which were polished very evenly and were tightly in contact with each other.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wondered how they cut the stone bricks so precisely.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The stone, except for the fern and grass in the fissure, did not appear to be so old, but definitely appeared genuine and not restored.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There was a gate, inside which one had to pay to visit.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I was given a plastic bag (which appeared strange to me at first), and was asked to take off my shoes.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Along the planned route of visit, one can see artifacts, for example a big bell’s mold, peony-carved bricks, dragon-shaped pillow remnant, the Ryukyu kings’ crown and seal, and a series of portraits of kings, all of them in the Mandarin costume.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">From what’s left here, the Ryukyu kings probably wrote calligraphy as skillfully as the Qing emperors.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And there were the tatami-mats where the king must have sat, and looked down his people proudly.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">To call servants in another room, they pulled a bell, which seemed intriguing to us.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These were all very interesting, but I found the stone-wall-building artistry to be most impressive above all.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">At the highest point there was an observation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One saw the China sea, the Tomari port I had been, the buildings that Naha city was, and the red roof-tiles of the palace that I was just moments ago.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I left the castle, and found a wood pavilion at the center of the lake, which would have been a nice resting place if it had not been so hot.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A sign explained that, in WWII, intense battles took place here, and American seized Okinawa, causing most ruin destroyed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">While the Ryukyu Kingdom had once dominated the island, and in its prime vowed to serve as the port of “thousands of countries”, all that now left was a broken castle.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The sentiment was all very noble, but I was hungry again.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Close to the castle a restaurant called Suimui-kan (首里杜館) seemed to be the only decent place to eat.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I ordered a soba-noodle, similar to what I had had in the America Village.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The stewed pork often contained cartilage and fat, which I didn’t like.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By the way, on the way back I helped a Thai woman — who lost her way back, could not speak English, and could not access Wifi — go to a police station.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Though it would be quite a while before the flight was to took off, I chose to get to the Naha airport earlier to pick some Aloha shirts hard to see in Taiwan (or are they?).</span></span>
