<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Ideally, we may agree, education at least helps citizens find a decent job fitting for their skills and aptitudes.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Given our advanced technology and welfare, how are we not appearing any closer to the utopia, if not even more remote?</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the first place, computers are rendering much education obsolete.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the past, just being literate gave you an advantage.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Those who knew how to use the typewriter could be typists,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and those who spoke another language would qualify as translators.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">So simple.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">No wonder the older generation thought a university degree was a guarantee for a secure job.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They cannot be so sure now.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Today typing your manuscript is a must,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and not everybody translates better than Google Translate.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Even stenographers and interpreters are threatened by speech recognition software.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">That&#39;s just a tip of the iceberg.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How often do we need to calculate big numbers by hand like we were trained in high school?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Do we even write with a pen any longer?</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, when the jobs are considerably less than the working age population, fierce competition occurs, which is scarcely regulated.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When 100 people are competing for 50 positions, lamentably, no matter how good they are, there will always be 50 people who leave unemployed; they remain in the labor market, spending more effort on exams and interviews, resulting in an invisible loss in production, in addition to their stress and affliction.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When a student invests another year in preparing exams for medical doctors, another possible human resource stands idle for another year.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Everyone settling for an underpaying job is also potentially wasting the opportunity cost.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The younger generation is facing a suffocating absurdity.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Not only is a degree borderline irrelevant except in ruling out job applicants,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but an outstanding performance as a student still does not guarantee jobs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Rather, the digital generation needs qualities other than calculation or memorization, such as curiosity, aspiration, individuality, or cordiality—which are unlikely to be tested nor taught in a pen and paper.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A framed diploma can be reassuring,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the depressing fact is that the education system fails in preparing and ensuring jobs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How do we do that then?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Should we instead rely on computer programs to hire people?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Or should we draw lots, which at least save some time and energy?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I have no idea.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is hard for me to imagine anything other than a deep disillusionment in education and a resulting instability of the social hierarchy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Maybe only then can we reshape our dysfunctional labor market.</span></span>
