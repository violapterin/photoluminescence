<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The more I learn higher mathematics, the more I wonder how little benefit elementary mathematics education has brought to children.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In light of the advance in computers, they are borderline useless and not indicative of the innate talent of the students.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Children spend a lot of time in school learning arithmetic, chiefly the four operations on real numbers, solution of linear systems, and manipulation involving polynomials.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As the level progresses, some of them struggle,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and others appear more capable.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Consequently, they either choose or abandon majors or occupations related to mathematics.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But in a broader perspective, these calculations are some simple algorithms in disguise.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Operations on a field, changing basis for a matrix, Euclid algorithm on a polynomial ring, and so on—we know that they are straightforward, if tedious, to program from scratch, since they are merely a bunch of rigid rules.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Geometric auxiliary lines are a nightmare to guess,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but they can be determined on a ring with Gröbner basis.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Trigonometry identities are said to be a torture,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but they are a nothing more than polynomial identities of exponential functions.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These matters are easy to program, but hard to calculate in head.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Presently, children who are faster and more accurate in exams, win.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What is the big deal about that?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What difference does it make, as long as most of them can do it correctly in sufficient time?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Today such basic calculations are what computers should do,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and apart from them, there is a lot more to explore in mathematics.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Indeed, the students are implementing a computer with their brain.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We practically require the children to invoke their vague intuition by themselves.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Unfortunately, children surely don’t know they are running a program with their brain when they take an exam.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Some children are better, and some are slower to grasp the insight.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For the latter, if they quit, they will never be revealed of the mystery,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and they will remain to think mathematics as an enigma.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">While it isn’t ideal to obscure children from the concept of computation,</span> <span class="serif-roman">undoubtedly many students in middle school aren’t ready, either, to learn programming and computation theory before they are exposed to concrete objects for several years.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Elementary mathematics education is in dire need of reformation,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and what can we do about the situation?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There, I hope, could be a way to somehow educate children more about computation,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so that they are self-aware when they do it,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it might turn out that the way we classify students’ inclination has been the very opposite of unleashing their gifts.</span></span>
