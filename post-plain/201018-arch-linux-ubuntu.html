<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In March 2017 I took pains to</span> <a class="serif-roman" href="https://www.violapterin.com/post/170317-installing-arch-linux.html">install Arch Linux</a> <span class="serif-roman">on my Lenovo Thinkpad.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This way, I was having two working computers, one Arch Linux on Thinkpad, one Windows on Surface,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Dropbox enabled file-sharing between them.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">So why did I choose Arch in the first place?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By then I hadn’t had any Linux experience,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and on seeing some internet posts which compared Linux distributions, my impression was that Arch allowed more customization, which sounded like my inclination.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In addition, I thought that if I partitioned the disk in person, it would be easier to modify the partition later.</span> <span class="serif-roman">I didn’t know installation was so convoluted,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but it wasn’t a real difficulty for me.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In May 2020, I started to use, on my Surface, the Windows subsystem for Linux–a new application Microsoft proposed to please Linux devotees.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It had most of the functionality Linux had,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and particularly conveniently, I could open files with the Windows file explorer, and edit with VS Code, without transferring files from Dropbox.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">From then on, I used Arch on Thinkpad less and less.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On October 18, 2020, when I tried to update Arch for the first time after a while, Pacman told me there were conflicting files.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I uninstalled several conflicting packages on the warning list, intending to reinstall everything;</span> <span class="serif-roman">after having restarted the laptop, the desktop was emptier,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Pacman wasn’t even recognized by the terminal.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I might have deleted some system packages, and probably used some flags for forcing.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Fortunately everything was backed up by Dropbox and copied on my Surface.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Incidentally I didn’t have a Arch Linux USB at hand,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and after some careful thought, I decided to install Ubuntu.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I do find on the internet quite a few people complaining about conflict packages when updating with Pacman.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Perhaps the matter is due to the rolling release, or (and) the less stable packages than Ubuntu.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Looking back now, apart from the fussy installation process (overtly so for laypersons), it isn’t a robust practice, to my eyes, to burden the user of resolving constant conflicts between updated packages.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It has been almost a year,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Ubuntu is doing fine.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There have never been conflicts in updating, even when I haven’t updated for a month.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Now I don’t understand the appeal of Arch at all.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I can’t think of a thing which Arch can do, but Ubuntu can’t.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Unless you are undertaking highly technical work which really requires Arch’s flexibility and privilege and you are well-versed in Linux, I simply suggest Ubuntu.</span></span>
