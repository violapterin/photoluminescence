<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In Taiwan, as I remember, elementary school instructors and textbooks notated division as</span> <span class="math"><span class="math-sign">\(\,\div\,\)</span></span><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">which is called the obelus.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Even then, I learnt, from more advanced books, that people use</span> <span class="math"><span class="math-plain">\(/\)</span></span><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">the solidus, or slash, to denote division.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Strangely, when I was in the first year of middle school (the 7th grade in the US), the math textbook announced,if I am not mistaken, that from now on, the obelus was to be discouraged and deprecated, and we shall always use fraction, and when the space does not allow, we use a solidus.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Except in elementary school textbooks and exercise books, or on some calculators, I have never seen the obelus elsewhere, in analysis, algebra, geometry, or any scientific publication.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Actually, the ISO 80000-2 standard for mathematical notation recommends only the solidus or fraction bar for division,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And it says that the obelus ‚Äúshould not be used‚Äù for division.</span></span> <span class="phrase">&ensp;</span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Why is the obelus taught in the elementary school, though it virtually never occurs elsewhere?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I see no advantage in teaching kids a very rare notation, obelus, and later abandoning it and enforcing the use of another notation, solidus.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is also mysterious why obelus stands for division, which Wikipedia doesn‚Äôt say.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On the contrary, a solidus is a fraction ‚Äúlying down‚Äù due to limited space, which is completely intuitive.</span></span> <span class="phrase">&ensp;</span>

<span class="phrase"><em class="serif-italic">Although previously used for subtraction, the obelus was first used as a symbol for division in 1659 in the algebra book Teutsche Algebra by Johann Rahn.</em> <em class="serif-italic">some think that John Pell, who edited the book, may have been responsible for this use of the symbol.</em></span> <span class="phrase">&ensp;</span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Maybe before the solidus was used, the obelus was first used to stand for division.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(By then, the convention of algebra equations was still being formed, and equations in ¬´Principia Mathematica¬ª were mainly written verbally.)</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Afterwards, the solidus was probably gradually widely used,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But elementary school textbooks, somehow, did not follow the trend, leaving the relic of old notation.</span></span> <span class="phrase">&ensp;</span>
