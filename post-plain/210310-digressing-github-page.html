<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">for this post, I didn't take detailed notes from time to time.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">in fact, I was not sure where this project is going.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">as I said, in writing mathematical posts, I was hard to please.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I want a more succint, readable, and precise source, which Markdown is not.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and I want typography features, which Markdown cannot express.</span> </span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">let me reaccount these considerations, to recapitulate and partly to organize my own thought.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">the easiest choice is just sticking to Mathjax in Markdown.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">however, one has to use Javascript preprocessing to effectively introduce macros, which is not flexible.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">some characters, such as</span> <pre class="mono"><</pre> <span class="serif-roman">and</span> <pre class="mono">></pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">conflict HTML,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and there was no unicode characters beyond standard LaTeX.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">moreover, the latest version does not break long expressions,</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">or it seems to be the best that I abandon Jekyll altogether,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I may use CSS to typeset fractions, vectors, and matrices,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and</span> <pre class="mono">\mathfrak</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">\mathbb</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">\mathcal</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and</span> <pre class="mono">\mathscr</pre> <span class="serif-roman">can be simulated by different fonts.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">superscripts and subscripts is inherent in HTML, though recursive applications may not look nice.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">for example, a double superscript is traditaionlly smaller than a single superscript, which has to be modified by a class.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">these are possible, but not easy.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I may not be capable of writing a system equivalent to Jekyll.</span> </span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">there are other options, after extensive search, such as invoking MathML or save everything as images.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">quickly I saw that directly input MathML is highly verbose.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">saving images will soon reach the limit of Github page, which is ^^1^^ GB.</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">lastly, for some time, perhaps by middle of December 2020, I actually considered completely abandoning traditional mathematical notation,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and I entertained the possibility of designing a new language expressed entirely in ASCII characters.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">the</span> <pre class="mono">+</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">-</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">*</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">/</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">^</pre> <span class="serif-roman">continue to mean basic operations,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and more complicated ones are to be represented by words</span> <pre class="mono">intergration</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <pre class="mono">differentiation</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">as in Mathematica.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">the downside is that I will not be able to communicate with other people.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">even if I link every post to a summary of convention, the probability that people insist to finish a post is diminishing.</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">therefore, between these months, I keep wondering what an ideal proof presentation would be.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I have the independent realization that traditional style of proof is in many ways inadequate.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">about the middle of August, I came across the Wikipedia post of Curry- Howard isomorphism, and that truly changed my worldview.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I searched widely to learn more about logic, mathematical foundation, intuitionistic mathematics, constructivism, type theory, and interactive theorem provers.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">since this account is not centered about, so to say, these new mathematics, I shall continue my train of thought about the GitHub pages without explaining these terms.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">in short, I had the urge to present classical mathematics in a more type theoretical style.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">a thorough approach might be designing a pseudo code for proof assistant, such as Coq,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">so that besides checking mentally, it is easy to rewrite in a way it can be checked via Coq too.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">additionally it is perhaps more asthetically pleasing to me to have a syntax which utilized only ASCII.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">January, Febuary, and March soon passed,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and it occurs to me classical mathematics has not missed much, if few little changes are made.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">just to be sure that I wasn't missing much, I took a look at several proposed mathematical foundation, such as the introduction and appendix of homotopy type theory, and the original papers of calculus of constructions.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">most importantly, I suggest that statements which are not identity nor partial orders, should not be buried in paragraphs, but occupy a lone line and numbered as equations.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">another suggestion is that when explaining the reason of a proposition, the reason should go before the equation, and these reasons are ordered according to the time of substitution.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">finally, application of law of excluded middle and nonconstructive axiom of choice should be announced every time.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">this way, it becomes likely to recover the Curry- Howard isomorphism.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">therefore, I realized that classical mathematics is fine, as long as I have a strong inclination to type theoretical interpretation.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">a balance between constructiveness and convention is feasible.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I may be very well content with more strictly natural deduction style presentation, to have a more reasonable scope of project.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">it simply remains to design a markup which describes normal text and mathematics, and outputs HTML.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">this markup, like Markdown does, describes italic and bold texts, and so on.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">moreover, there has to be a mark which denotes the beginning and end of math modes, where I am free to rename the symbols as I wish.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">the code within the math mode, in turn, is to be convered to standard LaTeX,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I am ready to code.</span> </span>
