<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As of this part, I didn‚Äôt take detailed notes from time to time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In fact, I wasn‚Äôt sure where this project was going.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As I said, in writing mathematical posts, I was hard to please.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wanted a more succinct, readable, and precise source, which Markdown was not.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And I wanted typography features, which Markdown couldn‚Äôt express.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Let me recount these considerations, to recapitulate and partly to organize my own thought.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The easiest choice was just sticking to Mathjax in Markdown.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, one had to use Javascript preprocessing to effectively introduce macros, which wasn‚Äôt flexible.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Some characters, such as</span> <code class="mono">&lt;</code> <span class="serif-roman">and</span> <code class="mono">&gt;</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">conflicted HTML,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and there were no unicode characters beyond those in standard LaTeX.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, the latest version didn‚Äôt break long expressions.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Or it seemed to be the best that I abandon Jekyll altogether,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but I might not be capable of writing a system equivalent to Jekyll.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I could use CSS to typeset fractions, vectors, and matrices,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and</span> <code class="mono">\mathfrak</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">\mathbb</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">\mathcal</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and</span> <code class="mono">\mathscr</code> <span class="serif-roman">could be simulated by different fonts.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Superscripts and subscripts were inherent in HTML, though recursive applications might not look nice.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For example, a double superscript was traditionally smaller than a single superscript, which probably had to be specified by a CSS class.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These tasks sounded possible, but not easy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There were other options, after extensive search, such as invoking MathML or save everything as images.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Quickly I realized that directly inputting MathML was highly verbose.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Saving images in the repository would soon reach the limit of Github page, which is</span> <span class="math"><span class="math-plain">\(1\)</span></span> <span class="serif-roman">GB.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Lastly, for some time, perhaps by middle of December 2020, I actually considered completely abandoning traditional mathematical notation,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I entertained the possibility of designing a new language expressed entirely in ASCII characters.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The symbols</span> <code class="mono">+</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">-</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">*</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">/</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">^</code> <span class="serif-roman">continue to mean basic operations,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and more complicated ones were to be represented by words</span> <code class="mono">integration</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <code class="mono">differentiation</code><span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">as in Mathematica.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The downside was that I wouldn‚Äôt be able to communicate with other people without additional effort.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Even if I linked every post to a summary of convention, the probability that people managed to finish a post was diminishing.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><b class="serif-bold">Rethinking proof presentation</b></span>
</p>
</div>
<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Largely inspired by such contemplation on mathematical notation, between these months I kept wondering what an ideal proof presentation would be.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I had the independent awareness that the traditional style of proof was in many ways inadequate.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">About the middle of August, I came across the Wikipedia post of Curry- Howard isomorphism,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and that truly changed my worldview1</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I searched widely to learn more about logic, mathematical foundation, intuitionistic mathematics, constructivism, type theory, and interactive theorem provers.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Since this narrative isn‚Äôt centered about, so to say, these sorts of new mathematics, I would continue my train of thought without explaining these fancy terms.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In short, I had the urge to present classical mathematics in a more constructive manner.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A thorough approach might be designing a pseudo code for a proof assistant, such as Coq,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so that besides checking mentally as we usually did, it was easy to rewrite the presentation in a way it could be checked via Coq too.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">By the way, it was perhaps more aesthetically appealing to me to have a syntax comprising only of ASCII.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">January, February, and March soon passed,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it occurred to me instead that classical mathematics was mostly fine, if few little changes were made.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Just to be sure that I wasn‚Äôt missing much, I took a look at several proposed mathematical foundation, such as the introduction and appendix of homotopy type theory, and the original papers of calculus of constructions.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Most importantly, my suggestion was that statements which weren‚Äôt identity nor partial orders, shouldn‚Äôt be buried in paragraphs, but should occupy a lone line and be numbered as equations.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, the reasons of a proposition should go just above the equation, and that these reasons should be ordered according to the order of substitution.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Finally, application of law of excluded middle and nonconstructive axiom of choice should be announced every time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These conventions could make it easier to recover the Curry- Howard isomorphism.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A balance between constructive inclination and tradition did appear to be feasible, making the scope of my project more reasonable.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It simply remains to design a markup which describes normal text and mathematics, and outputs HTML.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This markup, as Markdown does, distinguishes italic and bold texts, and so on.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Moreover, there has to be a mark which denotes the beginning and end of a math mode,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so I am free to rename the symbols as I wish.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The code in the math mode, in turn, is to be converted to standard LaTeX.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I am ready to code.</span></span>
