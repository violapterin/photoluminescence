<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The more I learn higher mathematics, the more I wonder how little benefit the elementary mathematics education has brought to children.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In light of the advance in computers, they are borderline useless and not indicative of the innate talent of the students.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Children spend a lot of time in school learning arithmetic, chiefly the four operations on real numbers, solution of linear systems, and calculation involving polynomials.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As the level progresses, some of them struggle,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and others appear good at it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Consequently, they either choose or abandon mathematics-related majors or occupations.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, in a broader perspective, these actions are some straightforward algorithms in disguise.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The students are really implementing a system of lambda calculus or an automata with their brain.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People capable of basic programming know that while it may be tedious to implement, from scratch, operations on a field, changing basis for a matrix, Euclid algorithm on a polynomial ring, and so on, they are in fact nothing more than a rigid realization of rules.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Today these are what computers should do,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and there is a lot more to explore in mathematics than these.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What difference does it make that someone is slightly faster and more accurate in such basic calculations that another, as long as they can do correctly under sufficient time?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Unfortunately, children surely don’t know they are considered machines when they take an exam,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and undoubtedly, they won’t before they are exposed to concrete objects.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Still, what troubles me is that we practically require the children to invoke their vague intuition on computation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Those who return more correct answers in exams, win.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What’s the big deal about that?</span> <span class="serif-roman">the reason that some children are doing well is simply that they are quicker to realize, implicitly, the way to run a program with their brain;</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the reason that some are not doing well, that they are slower.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For the latter, they will never be revealed of the mystery, and will probably remain to think mathematics as an enigma.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The elementary mathematics education is in dire need of reformation,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and what can we do about the situation?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There, I hope, might be a way to somehow introduce children of the concept of computation,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so that they are self-aware when they do it,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it might turn out that how we presently classify students’ inclination is the very opposite of unleashing their gifts.</span></span>
