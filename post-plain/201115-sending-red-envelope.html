<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Our protagonist has this series of (objectively boring) events happening today, as follows.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">They nevertheless made him happy,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but he wasn‚Äôt sure why.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A first friend of his, Mr Jiang the hacker, was getting married;</span> <span class="serif-roman">they were both in the electrical engineering department under advisor Prof Bingcheng,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Mr Jiang worked in Google now.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He wasn‚Äôt in the mood of attending the wedding banquet, because he was afraid of all the small talks on his future plan.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But the first message he received today saved him;</span> <span class="serif-roman">a second friend of his, Tina the erhu player, asked him whether he wanted to go to a concert for free in place of her, since she couldn‚Äôt go:</span> <span class="serif-roman">she had to attend an awards ceremony.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He nevertheless wanted to send the ‚Äúred envelope‚Äù, or money gift, to Mr Jiang;</span> <span class="serif-roman">he checked on the internet how much it should be, and counted bills to an amount more than serviceable considering they weren‚Äôt close.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He handed the envelope physically on the table and left, heading to the concert.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then it occurred to him, in the concert, he forgot to mark on the envelope that it was indeed for Mr Jiang, the groom,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the receptionist wouldn‚Äôt tell.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Would he get the money?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was so poorly- versed in social conventions that he often chose to be alone.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a premiere concert of newly commissioned pieces in Chinese style.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Composers stood up to receive applause after their pieces were performed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It struck him another time, seeing this, that he always had wanted to be a composer, an amateur one,</span> <span class="serif-roman">yet he lacked the talent and time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He had sometimes pictured that he would work during the day and compose music at night.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And the vision seemed so distant and vague to him, in the darkness in the concert hall, in front of the spotlight.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The concert ended,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Tina messaged the protagonist whether he enjoyed it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">‚ÄúI prefer a more modern style than a strictly pentatonic one.‚Äù he wrote.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">‚ÄúHave you been composing music lately?‚Äù she asked.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(He acquainted her only once at a recital by Dengkai, another common friend of theirs, where he said he sometimes compose music.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">‚ÄúHaven‚Äôt for some time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Will you help me if I write an erhu piece?‚Äù</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He asked.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Sure, she replied, showing genuine interest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Immediately she sent him a file which explained the ability of the erhu.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This cheered him up, so much that he was immediately in a whimsical mood, imagining erhu melodies in his head.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Several years ago, he was reminded, he said to a third friend of his, Melanie the flautist, that he would write a flute sonata and ask her to try it out.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She was now studying in Paris.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Months ago, intending to bring up the matter, he wrote some melodies and messaged them to her,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and she didn‚Äôt reply.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then, Mr Jiang messaged the protagonist to thank him for his envelope.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">‚ÄúI will perhaps ask you, some time, how it is like to work at Google.‚Äù he wrote.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Anytime, he replied.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Later, a fourth friend of his, Cassandra the pianist, also messaged the protagonist, remarking that she was getting married (too), and invited him to watch the live stream on Twitch, on which Melanie, their common friend, was also invited.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Amused, he messaged Melanie, mentioning the flute sonata.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She replied instantly, to his surprise, urging him to complete the piece.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He wished to dedicate the piece to her, he wrote, if it would indeed be done.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It would be an honor, she wrote, and she had found a piano accompanist.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This was how the protagonist, somehow, reconnected four friends, within one day.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These were trivial matters,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and they made him laugh, in the same way you earnestly believed a flaw to be grave but it might very well be immaterial, or an air to be serious, but be lighthearted, as when a cook in IKEA gave you eleven meatballs instead of ten, or a stapler failed to penetrate the last page.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was like this that he was having this unfounded epiphany on the street, in the rush hour in the evening, in a warm wintry breeze.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Things, at least some of the times, were going to be okay.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a common shortfall of ours to forget happy times when we were sad, which we nevertheless must try‚Äî as sad times when happy.</span></span>
