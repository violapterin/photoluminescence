<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Our protagonist have this series of (objectively boring) events happening today, as follows.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Somehow, they nevertheless made him happy.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A first friend of his, Mr Jiang the hacker, was getting married; he was a classmate of mine in the EE department, and worked in Google now.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He was not willing to attend the wedding banquet, because he is afraid of all the small talks on my future plan.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But the first message he received today saved him;</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">A second friend of mine, Tina the erhu instructor, asked him whether he wanted to go to a concert for free in place of her, because she could not go.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She had to attend an awards ceremony.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He nevertheless wanted to send the “red envelope”, that is money gift, to Mr Jiang;</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He checked the internet, and counted 2 800, more than serviceable considering they are not close.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thus, he handed the envelope physically and left, going to the concert.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then, it occurred to him in the concert, he forgot to mark on the envelope that it was indeed for Mr Jiang, the groom,</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And the receptionist would not tell.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Would he get the money? he was so poorly versed in social conventions that he often chose to be alone.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was a premiere concert of newly commissioned pieces in Chinese style.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Composers stood up to receive applause after their pieces were performed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It struck him another time, seeing this, that he always had wanted to be a composer, an amateur one, yet he lacked the talent and time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He had sometimes pictured that he shall work during the day and compose music at night.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And the vision looked so distant and vague, he thought, in the blackness in the concert hall, in front of the spotlight.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The concert ended, and Tina messaged him whether he enjoyed it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“I prefer a more modern style.” he wrote.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Have you been composing music lately?” she asked.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(He acquainted her only once at a recital of another common friend of ours, where he said he sometimes compose music.)</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“Haven’t for some time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Will you help me if he write an erhu piece?”</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He asked.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Sure, she replied, showing genuine interest.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Immediately she sent him a file which explained the erhu’s ability.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This cheered him up, so much that he was immediately in a whimsical mood, imagining erhu melodies in my head.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Several years ago, he recalled, he said to a third friend of mine, Melania the flautist, that he would write a flute sonata and ask her to try it out.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She was studying in Paris.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Months ago, intending to bring up the matter, he wrote some melodies and messaged them to her, and she didn’t reply.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then, Mr Jiang messaged him to thank him for my envelope.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">“I will perhaps ask you, some time, how it is like to work at Google.” he wrote.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Anytime, he wrote.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Later, a fourth friend of hime, Cassandra the pianist, messaged him, remarking that she was getting married (too), and invited him to watch the live stream on YouTube, and Melania, our common friend, was also invited.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Amused, he messaged Melania, mentioning the flute sonata.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She replied instantly, to his surprise, urging him to complete the piece.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He wished to dedicate the piece to her, he wrote, if it would indeed be done.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It will be an honor, she wrote, and she had found a piano accompanist.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This was how the protagonist, somehow, reconnected four friends, within one day.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">These were trivial matters, and they made him laugh, in the same way you earnestly believe a flaw to be grave but it may very well be immaterial, or an air to be serious, but be lighthearted, as when a cook gave you eleven meatballs instead of ten, or a stapler failed to penetrate the last page.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was like this he was having this unfounded epiphany on the street, in the rush hour in the evening, in a warm wintry breeze.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Things, at least some of the times, are going to be okay.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is a common shortfall of ours to forget happy times when we are sad, which we nevertheless must try — as sad times when happy.</span></span>
