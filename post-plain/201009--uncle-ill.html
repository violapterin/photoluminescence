<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The protagonist was aware that his uncle Xitai, his mother’s eldest brother, had cancer, only after it was getting serious.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The fact gradually sank into his head, by the time it was mentioned two or three times, starting from a worried call picked up by his mother in about June, concluding with an announcement that he was admitted into palliative care.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Uncle and his family currently lived in the US,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he had seen him only twice,</span> <span class="serif-roman">so he didn’t feel much sadness, except the emptiness that emerged every time he knew somebody was dying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">His mother didn’t appear to be weeping, though,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he didn’t actively bring up the matter.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He could only imagine how devastated Xitai’s wife was, from the broken English (even having stayed in the US for decades) which she wrote on Line to repeatedly ask the Lord for his blessing.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">How terrifying it would be to face death, the protagonist imagined, such that even the most intelligent ones, including Einstein and Grothendieck, could in their last days convert from atheists to believers?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Religions, he knew, helped people cope with their short and brutal life.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Nevertheless, how were they persuaded that what they wished for was real, as long as they wished?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">(He once read through a long Reddit discussion on the reasons atheists converted to believers,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and that didn’t clarify the matter any more.)</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The next day, perhaps to alleviate the ominous air, he went for a walk in National Taiwan University, and visited the Campus Bookstore for the first time after the remodelling.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the Christian bookstore, one of the displayed books was «The Reason for God» by Timothy Keller,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and he recalled Isaac the chess player, in one of his apologetic posts, had shared quotes by Keller.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He picked it up and skimmed.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Considering our natural craving beyond the material realm—it so argued—didn’t it hint that the immaterial realm could actually exist?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He put it down and went upstairs.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It was here that once Celia pressed him to join a church gathering for Bible interpretation, and he wouldn’t, which led to their arguments and finally a breakup.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Those translations of western canons disappeared, leaving a more hollow second floor, except the Bibles of course.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the middle of the night, at 3 or 4, the protagonist’s mother reported that Xitai was dying.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Everybody died, he thought in his fading consciousness before falling asleep.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Still, why did some believe that they would be more than dust when they were gone?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As long as such possibilities made they feel better?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Maybe that was a certain form of optimism, just as the belief that that their life had a value?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then it was hard to blame that many accepted it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But he didn’t.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">He would face the everlasting, meaningless suffering life would certainly offer in abundance.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">People died together,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but he died alone.</span></span>
