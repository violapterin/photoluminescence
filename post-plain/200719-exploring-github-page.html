<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">today, at about 5:30 pm Taiwan time, I registered a 2nd GitHub account,</span> <pre class="mono">violapterinblog</pre> <span class="serif-roman">,</span> <span class="serif-roman">to set up this GitHub Page (GHP).</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">the new site was born!</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">every account of GitHub was allowed to own 1 GHP, endowed with a unique URL derived from the username.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I would like to import some past posts and modify the time stamp accordingly, so let this notice attest to the moment of what was supposedly a new start.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">one reason I want to have a personal site is to write notes containing mathematics, of either popular or research level.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">about just one year ago, I created a WordPress (WP) account, mainly because they support LaTeX (to some extent).</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">WP’s interface is straighforward, their templates modern and elegant, and their email support prompt and helpful.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">so why did I move away?</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">WP only allowed the user to type in the web interface,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and one could not write and save locally.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">WP does not allow a lot of CSS, let alone Javascript, except in some expensive plans.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">more importantly, it required ++latex ...++ for LaTeX expression, which can be verbose,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and there was no way to compile and preview one’s work.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">thus I basically stopped writing on the WP site after a while.</span> </span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">this May, a friend recommended GHP to me.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I researched about that,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and it sounded much like what I intend.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">it supported Mathjax, a free engine of LaTeX rendition, enabling me to write mathematics.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and I may also write on a local machine and commit, which is more convenient and reliable,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and commit records would also better protect my intellectual property.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">finally, no matter what fancy thing I might want to do, as long as I converted the piece to standard HTML, it would be fine.</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">found the Jekyll template provided officially by Jekyll group, which was incredibly helpful.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">copied the code to my repo,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and for the first time, my site worked on localhost, via ++bundle exec jekyll serve++.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">after I committed, the default domain ++violapterinblog.github.io++ was also rendered successfully on the browser, which was exciting!</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">Jekyll called Kramdown, a Markdown standard, by default.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">realized that Jekyll allowed raw html code protected by tags,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">so I might actually write directly in HTML.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">but it did not harm to try Kramdown first.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">tried to call Mathjax, which Kramdown was said to call, with no avail.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">it was pointed out that Mathjax seemed to have difficulty recognizing ++++.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">thus one had to apply the snippet on the official document “Changes in the Mathjax API”, which solved everything.</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">last year, I had bought a domain under WP account,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">And today I finally transfered that to the GHP.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">I asked WordPress staff via email,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and their response was so kind!</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">the instruction had always been there,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and I never read carefully.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">to point a domain managed by WordPress- com, towards my GHP, I had to add a DNS CNAME- record and Apex domains on WordPress- com.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">then simply add the CNAME on the web interface for GitHub repo of the GHP.</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">a critical progress!</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">this night, I was thinking intensively of an imagined command.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">this command should display a first glyph on the document, but throw it away from the “stack” (or whatever), and display a second glyph like usual,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">so that the ensuing, third glyph knew only the second glyph, but not the first one.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">if only there is exactly such TeX command!</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">but I was not optimistic, as I felt this did not quite agree the spirit of TeX’s design.</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">meanwhile, I was troubled by the ugliness of the ++\unicode++ letters with accents.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">then, when researching Stack Overflow about ++\overset++ and ++\underset++, I saw several posts</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">explaining the plain-TeX control sequence ++\smash++.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">its name alone sounded just like what I was after!</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">to elaborate, macro</span> <pre class="mono">\smash {<subformula>}</pre> <span class="serif-roman">is in Plain TeX;</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">it yields the same result as ++subformula++, but makes the height and depth zero.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">by using both ++\smash++ and ++\vphantom++ one can typeset any subformula, and give it any desired height and depth.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">for more explanation, see TeXbook (p 178),</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and its implementation is in Appendix B (p 360):</span> </span>

<span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">unfortunately, most miscellaneous symbols were not in Noto Sans nor Noto Serif, which means I might have to stick to Mathjax.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">but as I said, ++\unicode++ extension allows one to use unicode characters not provided by LaTeX, even Japanese Hiragana and Kanji.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">at this point, I decided to take a break to learn a good deal of HTML, CSS, Javascript, as well as Jekyll, SASS, and Kramdown.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">hopefully, the solution of some problems will come naturally afterwards,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">or at least, knowing more web programming can only be beneficial to one’s career.</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">by now, I had spent too much on these matters which this post explains,</span> </span> <span class="phrase"> <span class="serif-roman">and I had better focus on the very writing which this site was constructed for.</span> </span>
