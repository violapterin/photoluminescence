<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Think about how much has changed in the past 50 years in an exponential acceleration.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Meeting used to be the only way of communication.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mails existed thousands of years ago, and telegrams, just one hundred years ago.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then email and text messages came into view in the whirl of the internet revolution,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and social media and video calls emerged in the last decade thanks to the growth of internet speed.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Likewise, social media helped me make friends and disclose myself in a safe, sheltered space, no matter in my messy study or on a shaded park bench.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I can reply to online friends after taking my time to think of it when I am in the mood.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">TVs and movie theaters are replaced by Youtube and Netflix, which is not confined to a specific time.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Space is therefore expanded and time blurred,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and we are liberated from the hectic city, and are soaring beyond the realm of our senses.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Text bears our thoughts and values,</span> <span class="serif-roman">voice unveils our emotions and manners,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but the image, though consuming the most computational complexity, carries our appearance rather than essence.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Among them, language is the pinnacle of our civilization.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It can be seen as the prototype metaverse, a network consisting of past and future, possibility and contradiction, individuality and generality, which you dive in, hoping that your peculiarity might at all be understood by somebody in front of you or from the opposite time zone, who likes to listen to Gregorian chants in the rain or to bone the fish before eating, exactly as you do.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">First you worry whether the reply that you aren&#39;t going to the concert is soft enough, and whether your recent post criticizing the worker&#39;s parade conforms to majority views.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then you worry whether the filter applied to your food is vivid enough, and whether the meme of Shiba Inu is outdated.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then in a party you attend through your avatar, recurs the ancient fear that you are less attractive, less humorous, less erudite, less charismatic, and not knowing to grip a glass of bordeaux at the base.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Impossible.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As if you move a stew away from an ant colony to another table, only to find the next morning that it has attracted another colony, or if you heat up a stale stew to sterilize, and forget to eat until it rots anyway.</span></span>
