<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Dogs and cats are among the most beloved pets.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Cats are undoubtedly adorable,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but dogs, people say, are more loyal, as they love their owner unconditionally and foolishly, even if the owner beats it or lets it starve, as we sometimes learn in the news.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I have this friend Yanjun, who now lives alone,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and she wants to have a dog as a company.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She had a tense relation with her parents,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and she recalled that, this year on her birthday, “my mother wished me a happier life I should have enjoyed in my prime years”.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She was moved.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And later she regretted having been moved.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It reminds me of ‹Deep-Holes›, a short story by Alice Munro.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">There were this son Kent, the father Alex a geologist, and the mother Sally.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As the family went with Alex to wildness to collect stone specimens, Kent fell into a cave,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and the father helped him out.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The kid broke his legs, recovered, and remained slightly but permanently injured.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For once, Alex said that he saved Kent not due to love, but to familial duty, indicating that they weren’t close.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When he was in college, Kent disappeared and stopped contact.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Years passed,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and Alex died.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">One day, Sally saw on TV that Kent volunteered as a firefighter.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">She met him,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it turned out he was living a Bohemian lifestyle, together with a community of the homeless, who volunteered to help local people.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Kent told her of his anguish, that he derived no joy in helping people, but merely felt so obliged.</span></span>
</p>

<div class="section">
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The question which plagued the short story is why Kent left his parents and desired such a life.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I got it when I reread after months.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Because Kent remained feeling indebted to Alex’s favor.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The parents are the world of the baby, while the baby is but a negligible bit of the parents.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is terrifying to have been born, if we must suffer such an unequal situation.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Or Alex may be God, and Kent be Christ.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is more distressing than fortunate to be saved by Christ, because we ought to “take his yoke upon him and learn from him”, as Christ resolved to be crucified.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">And what a grave responsibility.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Thus I’m afraid to have a dog.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I hug it, I imagine,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and it will have the amorous look on my face, yearning and innocent, like I’m some immaculate deity.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But I’m not.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I’m sinned.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It isn’t that I won’t tend it properly.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">No, I would walk it well, feed it well, “out of duty”,</span> <span class="serif-roman">but what if I don’t love it,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and what if it continues to turn back and gaze at me?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We can do nothing but continue the stifling daily life, by having mercy on those not loved, and being enslaved by those who don’t love.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I won’t be a father nor a Christian, I gather, but will remain alone, and will not keep a dog.</span></span>
