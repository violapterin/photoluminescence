<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In Jasons Market Place, where I passed by on the road home, several chunks of Selles-sur-Cher cheese seemed to have a hard time getting sold, as they were lying on the shelf for days.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I didn’t blame people for avoiding this exotic food, which had on its surface such sinister dark blue wrinkles resembling gyri in a brain.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Out of rebellion, I bought a piece of Selles-sur-Cher, and tried.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I didn’t like it.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Even stronger than blue cheese, the poignant smell and taste, curiously appealing and appalling at the same time, could hardly be swallowed with a big bite without a good mouthful of red wine.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">When I was a child, I used to wonder why these cheeses with mold were edible.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But they turned out to be so good;</span> <span class="serif-roman">they are the prime example of something atrocious in appearance yet lovely in heart.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then it occurred to me that mushrooms are edible, which we are too familiar to doubt, and that both mushrooms and molds are fungi.</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In the documentary «Fantastic Fungi», we can watch, in the time-lapse filming,    the body of a mouse engulfed by hyphae until only hairs remain,    or the growing mushrooms which sway erratically from the weight of their caps,    or the mold spreading on an orange       like thunderclouds eager to take control, before bolts and bolts of thunder, ominous and menacing, pierce the earth through to suck out every bit of energy.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Fungi are a indispensable part of the ecosystem, since they transport energy from the dead to the living;</span> <span class="serif-roman">they form a network, which can detect and cooperate, as if having its own senses;</span> <span class="serif-roman">in addition, they produce mycotoxins, which kill bacteria and other microbes, to protect themselves.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">I wonder what they really are, these destructors and constructors, friends and fiends.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What happened, then, to those primitives who tasted moldy cheeses?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">For those brave enough to do it, good for them;</span> <span class="serif-roman">at least I wouldn’t, if nobody told me that the hairy, smelly thing was safe.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Indeed, such a habit might as well have led to food poisoning, had they picked toxic molds.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Quite plausibly, those who survived told the elders of the information,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and others just died.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Every time we have a bite, let us for a second mourn for those nameless martyrs who paid with their lives for trying out new kinds of mold.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">However, people who tried blue cheese were lucky.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Mycotoxins produced by penicillium chrysogenum isn’t toxic to humans;</span> <span class="serif-roman">even better, it came to be the source of penicillin, the first antibiotics, which saved numerous soldiers’ lives in the Second World War.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This is the reason those benign moldy cheeses, along with stinky tofu and fermented fish, last so much longer.</span></span>

<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The use of psychedelics, in addition, has a long history in ancient tribes,</span> <span class="serif-roman">and I suspect that it contributed to most ostensible religious experiences, and hence those religions.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">What I didn’t know is that many bans of psychedelics are pretty recent, about when its usage surged in the 1960s, the age of hippies.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Presently, some medical experts are instead advocating the merits of psychedelics in treating psychological diseases, such as trauma and depression, if used moderately.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Those who took psychedelics in the treatment described the feeling to be powerful, joyful, and peaceful, just as what spiritual experiences are said to be.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The humanoid images, the wobbling contours, the kaleidoscope of shapes, and various transcendental, ineffable forms, which they claimed to have contact with—do they belong to the realm of the altered state of consciousness known to a meditating Buddhist monk or a praying Christian nun?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Is it like the moment (I gather) we have,    when the first note a pianist plays resonates in a majestic hall, freezing the air and stopping the time,    or when tired of talking, guests at a table all get quiet incidentally, silent but content, still but wishful?</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Whatever that is, I wish I knew, but I don’t.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It isn’t the real world I recognize.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The world, as far as I see, is more infinite nausea and vice, than is infinite beauty and love:</span> <span class="serif-roman">beauty and love are something I am not meant to know, not as those who open their arms and close their eyes to become the unity,    ironically like fungi themselves,       which are endlessly expanding, are residing inside us, before us, and after us, and thus are continuing the eternal struggle between life and death, between one and many.</span></span>
