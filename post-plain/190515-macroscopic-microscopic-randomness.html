<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Random variables, it would seem, arise in two contexts.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">According to quantum mechanics, the collapse of wave function produces truly random outcomes, since Bell’s inequality disallows any hidden variable theory.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Let us call for convenience that quantum systems are first kind random.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">But what is the nature of macroscopic random events?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Let us say we roll a die.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The angle by which the die rotates, the slightest perturbation of dust, the rough surface it lands on, are all random variables, and they are so random that the point of die follows the uniform distribution.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Still, it is possible to consider the system as completely deterministic.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In fact, classical mechanics describes the evolution of system in the phase space.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Then chaos theory explains the mystery of randomness, that deterministic systems may be able to produce seemingly random results.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Let us call them second kind random.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">It is then inevitable to conclude that, strangely, somehow the first kind randomness generates the second-kind-randomness.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The reason might be the central limit theorem and law of large numbers.</span></span>
</p>
<p class="paragraph">
<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">On the other hand, the second-kind-randomness in turn simulates the first-kind-randomness.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">As an example, the distribution of prime numbers is deterministic, yet they resemble a normal distribution in a certain sense.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">In fact, this is what I think mathematics only does.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The probability theory does not rule out a completely static interpretation.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The event space is just a static collection of outcomes, and the expectation is just an integration.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">The theory of probability is no doubt rigorous in derivation, but the very core concept that lies in it, the probability, lies only in our heart.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">We have defined everything except the most crucial one: what randomness is.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Can it be that we shall never know?</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">Are they something we see everyday, but cannot be said?</span></span>

<span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">This is what urged me to learn about Bayes theory and algorithmic randomness.</span></span> <span class="phrase"><span class="serif-roman">More on the matter to come.</span></span>
