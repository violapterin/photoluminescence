@@in light of the advance in computers, they are borderline useless and not indicative of the innate talent of the students.@@ '

@@children #spend a lot of time in school learning arithmetic, chiefly the four operations on real numbers, solution of linear systems, and calculation involving polynomials.@@ _
@@as the level $progresses, some of them #struggle,@@
@@and others #appear good at it.@@ _
@@consequently, they either choose or abandon mathematics- related majors or occupations.@@ '

@@however, in a broader perspective, these actions are some straightforward algorithms in disguise.@@ _
@@the students are really implementing a system of lambda calculus or an automata with their brain.@@ _
@@people capable of basic programming #know <that while it may be tedious to implement, from scratch, operations on a field, changing basis for a matrix, Euclid algorithm on a polynomial ring, and so on, they are in fact nothing more than a rigid realization of rules.@@ _
@@today these are what computers should do,@@
@@and there is a lot more to explore in mathematics than these.@@ '

@@what $troubles me is <that we practically #require the children themselves to invoke their vague intuition on computation>.@@ _

@@what is the big deal about that?@@
@@what difference $does it make <that some are slightly faster and more accurate in such basic calculations, as long as most of them can do correctly under sufficient time>?@@ '

@@the reason that some children are %doing well is merely <that they are quicker to realize implicitly the way to run a program with their brain>;@@
