@@the original Nanmen Market [南 門 市 場] is a curious place,@@
@@and lately some dear recollections have &resurfaced.@@ '

@@when it $comes to the new- year shopping in those “groceries from South to North” [南 北 貨], Dihua street [迪 化 街] and Nanmen Market are the prime choices.@@ _
@@the retreat to Taiwan back in the Chinese civil war incidentally @endowed us dishes in the “eight styles”,@@
@@and a thorough walk in Nanmen’s $does provide a representative if incomplete sample.@@ '

@@seldom have I &bought ingredients from Nanmen’s, after I @started cooking myself.@@ _
@@a few kinds of supplies {I #do replenish} are dried foods— the cured Jinhua ham [金 華 火 腿] for stewing, infant shrimps for frying, baby fish for sauces, and scallop for steamed egg.@@ _
@@a slight disappointment is however the lack of Xinjiang pepper as of now, {which $has a flavor heavy but not excessively spicy}.@@ _
@@to make the fried- cured- meat- with- garlic- leaf, {which I #crave for every year or two}, one can’t go wrong with Nanmen’s, or possibly the “Peng’s Hunan Cured Meat” [彭 記 湖 南 臘 肉].@@ '

@@the stinky tofu, if steamed rather than fried, I #tell you, $smells ten times worse.@@ _
@@if you #find it not strong enough, #do leave that in room temperature for days to let it ferment,@@
@@and the softer it is, the more stinky, so much <that it can well deserve a quarantine in the balcony>.@@ _
@@but I @stopped buying it upon discovering <that it is made from gene- modified soybeans>, and later, to avoid extra estrogen in it.@@ '

@@Jinhua ham too is finicky to make, in <that, rather unlike the honey- cured ham, it $requires more than a year to age>.@@ _
@@but an old store {I #frequent} $has their own bacteria colonies, and even their own factory in Taoyuan {that $insists on using local Taiwan pork}: a principle ({which I @failed to appreciate before}) rare in the time of pig pandemic and with the presence of the contending imported US pork.@@ '

@@while Guangdong people #love to have the ham- in- steamed- soup, ham actually @originated in Zhejiang in the era of Northern Song.@@ _
@@the Northeastern sour cabbage, equally indispensable in seasoning the hot pot, is another thing:@@ _
@@as the salt $brings out the sweetness, the sour cabbage $rids the oil.@@ _
@@indeed I have once, out of rebelliousness, &made a sour- cabbage- with- fat- meat pot with leaner pork,@@
@@and they simply @didn’t go well,@@
@@and I so @realized the wisdom of insisting fat meat passed all along from the ancestors.@@ '

@@but as for cooked food, quite a few highly #regard the Yichang Royal House [億 長 御 坊], {where I #remember a more friendly price before it @enjoyed its fame}.@@ _
@@the sweet- sour ribs, and the baby- fish- with- chillies have &stayed in my childhood memories;@@
@@though after I could cook better, I hardly #purchase them any longer.@@ _
@@still there are the “Lion’s Head”, a stewed meatball, and the braised- goldfish- with- green- onion, one in Huaiyang style and one in Sichuan style, all so intricate yet meticulous prepared <that I can hardly tell the original ingredients by their final look>,@@
@@hence my principle of refraining from eating out is reluctantly &compromised, when I #fancy them once in a long while.@@ '

@@just next to the stairs in the basement of Nanmen’s, is a stand of Chouzhou- style Zongzi [潮 州 粽], {which at its best is comparable to that of Dintaifung’s [鼎 泰 豐]}.@@ _
@@another stand $sells some mantou, baozi, among other sweet breads and pastas.@@ _
@@(but you #have to go up to the second floor for babaofan, a sweet rice with fruits.)@@ _
@@further down the basement are stands of raw foods, such as some ridiculously priced vegetables, and giant pork rib bones excellent for stew, {which are &sold out so early in the morning}.@@ _
@@in the end of hall, before electronic slaughter was &popularized by the government, there @used to be a stand of raw chicken,@@
@@and it was there {that I have &seen chicken slaughtered, blood drained, and hair removed by hot water}.@@ _
@@the peculiar dark walk therefore @cast, for some time, a long shadow in me when I was a kid.@@ '

@@Jinfeng’s [金 峰] Loobahpng [滷 肉 飯], or ‘rice with minced pork’, served there with fried tofu, is something I have &favored as a kid,@@
@@but my taste buds somehow no longer #prefer them.@@ _
@@while it has &been a tourists’ place of interest, the incredibly long queue always $astonishes me.@@ _
@@a path near Jinfeng’s $leads to a stand of Loumei [滷 味], or ‘soy- braised snacks’.@@ _
@@there, they #know to cure ingredients overnight to let the sauce in.@@ _
@@tofu, chicken wings, chicken legs, and wood- ears are the best in my opinion,@@
@@and the holder is so good at advertising, <that you #have to “harden your ear” and stand firm in your ground>.@@ '

@@PS.@@ _
@@The original Nanmen Market is being &remodeled, and $has moved into a makeshift building for now.@@ '
