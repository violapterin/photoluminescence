   @@on my Lenovo Thinkpad.@@ _
@@this way, I was %having two working computers, one Arch Linux on Thinkpad, one Windows on Surface,@@
@@and Dropbox @enabled file- sharing between them.@@ _
@@so why @did I choose Arch in the first place?@@ _
@@by then I hadn’t &had any Linux experience,@@
@@and on seeing some internet posts {which @compared Linux distributions}, my impression was <that Arch @allowed more customization}, {which @sounded like my inclination}>.@@ _
@@in addition, I @thought <that if I @partitioned the disk in person, it would be easier to modify the partition later>.@@
@@I @didn’t know <installation was so &convoluted>,@@
@@but it wasn’t a real difficulty for me.@@ _

@@in May 2020, I @started to use, on my Surface, the Windows subsystem for Linux– a new application {Microsoft @proposed to please Linux devotees}.@@ _
@@it @had most of the functionality {Linux @had},@@
@@and particularly conveniently, I could open files with the Windows file explorer, and edit with VS Code, without transferring files from Dropbox.@@ _
@@from then on, I @used Arch on Thinkpad less and less.@@ '

@@on October 18, 2020, when I @tried to update Arch for the first time after a while, Pacman told me there were conflicting files.@@ _
@@I @uninstalled several conflicting packages on the warning list, intending to reinstall everything;@@
@@after having &restarted the laptop, the desktop was emptier,@@
@@and Pacman wasn’t even &recognized by the terminal.@@ _
@@I might have &deleted some system packages, and probably @used some flags for forcing.@@ _
@@fortunately everything was &backed up by Dropbox and copied on my Surface.@@ _
@@incidentally I @didn’t have a Arch Linux USB at hand,@@
@@and after some careful thought, I @decided to install Ubuntu.@@ '

@@I #do find on the internet quite a few people complaining about conflict packages when updating with Pacman.@@ _
@@perhaps the matter is due to the rolling release, or (and) the less stable packages than Ubuntu.@@ _
@@looking back now, apart from the fussy installation process (overtly so for laypersons), it isn’t a robust practice, to my eyes, to burden the user of resolving constant conflicts between updated packages.@@ '

@@it has &been almost a year,@@
@@and Ubuntu is %doing fine.@@ _
@@there have never &been conflicts in updating, even when I haven’t &updated for a month.@@ _
@@now I @don’t understand the appeal of Arch at all.@@ _
@@I can’t think of a thing {which Arch can do, but Ubuntu can’t}.@@ _
@@unless you are %undertaking highly technical work {which really $requires Arch’s flexibility and privilege and you are well- versed in Linux}, I simply #suggest Ubuntu.@@ '
