剛結束的東京奧運令我想到《來自紅花坂》裡的一張 1964 東京奧運的海報；
去年吉卜力釋出 fair use 的電影截圖，這張剛好呼應時事，就被一些人拿來當梗圖。
那時我才知道 1964 東京也有辦過奧運，而且也沒看過《來自紅花坂》，就在 Netflix 上看了。
不知道導演是否刻意加入東京奧運這個細節，但這張海報很呼應全劇的訊息。

高中生松崎海的父親在朝鮮戰爭中陣亡，她負責照料旅社；
雖然爸爸已經不在，每天她都會升起信號旗，當成一個儀式。
風間俊和松崎海互相喜歡，但風間以為他們是兄妹，默默和松崎疏遠。因為風間知道他是養子，從一個老照片中以為生父就是松崎的爸爸。其實風間是被人送給松崎家，松崎父母又再送給風間的養父。
最後一位老船長來見風間和松崎，確認他們不是兄妹。

其中有一個支線是，學校有一棟老社辦，要被拆毀。
風間想要維修老社辦，和松崎坐車到另一個城市見一位長官，希望長官不要拆毀，就是截圖的部分，背景有東京奧運海報。
最後學生們維修之後，長官決定維持社辦。
這樣兩件事都解決以後，應該皆大歡喜，結尾的氛圍卻沒有一點喜悅的感覺。
我們不知道風間和松崎有沒有繼續他們的感情，只看見在悲傷的歌曲配樂中，松崎再度升旗，等待不會歸來的父親。

我覺得這部電影的主題是，罪人能不能擁有幸福。
現代化的思想是否能和老社辦並存；
顛沛流離的戰後年代，不能阻止年輕人追求感情。
我很難理解日本這個國家。
日本是戰敗國，卻希望從1964奧運中展現他們的改革。
經歷金融危機，希望在2021奧運證明他們的國力。
日本中年人似乎充滿父權思想，但森喜朗因失言下台，似乎又表示已經有女性主義思潮。日本人快速西化，又酷愛漢字，書法，茶道，禪。
真正的問題在於，人類有沒有可能原諒。
日本和德國以前殺人，國民黨也殺人，我相信今天的民眾幾乎沒有人認為這些是對的，他們看到別國人一再檢討上一輩做過的事，應該也很痛苦。
但怎麼樣是真的懺悔?
怎樣才能真的原諒?
如果懺悔就能求得原諒，為何不先犯罪再說?
如果懺悔也不能買得原諒，罪人的一生就毀了嗎?

我們知道自己有原罪，卻一再犯罪；
我們期望寬恕，卻無法寬恕。
人類渺小，狹隘，自私，衝動，唯一擁有的是希望。
希望就像山丘上的一面旗子，我們每天期待海的另一端有人看見它，卻一再失望。
我們一天一天等待，夕陽從海面落下了，隔天再升起旗子，這樣用盡一生的力氣等待，等著被愛，等著被理解，等待和平，等病毒消失，等到頭髮白了，牙齒都沒了，剩下一口氣了，卻還不明白，原來希望根本就不會降臨。
