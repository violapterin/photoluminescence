@@dogs and cats are among the most beloved pets.@@ _
@@cats are undoubtedly adorable,@@

@@it $reminds me of ‹Deep-Holes›, a short story by Alice Munro.@@ _
@@there were this son Kent, the father Alex a geologist, and the mother Sally.@@ _
@@as the family @went with Alex to wildness to collect stone specimens, Kent @fell into a cave,@@
@@and the father @helped him out.@@ _
@@the kid @broke his legs, @recovered, and @remained slightly but permanently injured.@@ _
@@for once, Alex @said <that he @saved Kent not due to love, but to familial duty>, indicating <that they weren’t close>.@@ '

@@when he was in college, Kent @disappeared and @stopped contact.@@ _
@@years @passed,@@
@@and Alex @died.@@ _
@@one day, Sally @saw on TV <that Kent @volunteered as a firefighter>.@@ _
@@she @met him,@@
@@and it @turned out <he was %living a Bohemian lifestyle, together with a community of the homeless, {who @volunteered to help local people}>.@@ _
@@Kent @told her of his anguish, <that he @derived no joy in helping people, but merely @felt so obliged>.@@ '

@@the question {which @plagued the short story} is <why Kent @left his parents and @desired such a life>.@@ _
@@I @got it when I @reread after months.@@ _
@@because Kent @remained feeling indebted to Alex’s favor.@@ _
@@the parents are the world of the baby, while the baby is but a negligible bit of the parents.@@ _
@@it is %terrifying to have been born, if we must suffer such an unequal situation.@@ '

@@or Alex may be God, and Kent be Christ.@@ _
@@it is more %distressing than fortunate to be saved by Christ, because we ought to “take his yoke upon him and learn from him”, as Christ @resolved to be crucified.@@ _
