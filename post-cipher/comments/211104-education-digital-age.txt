@@ideally, we may agree, education at least helps citizens find a decent job fitting for their skills and aptitudes.@@ _
@@given our advanced technology and welfare, how are we not appearing any closer to the utopia, if not even more remote?@@ '

@@in the first place, computers are rendering much education obsolete.@@ _
@@in the past, just being literate gave you an advantage.@@ _
@@those who knew how to use the typewriter could be typists,@@
@@and those who spoke another language would qualify as translators.@@ _
@@so simple.@@ _
@@no wonder the older generation thought a university degree was a guarantee for a secure job.@@ _
@@they cannot be so sure now.@@ _
@@today typing your manuscript is a must,@@
@@and not everybody translates better than Google Translate.@@ _
@@even stenographers and interpreters are threatened by speech recognition software.@@ _
@@that's just a tip of the iceberg.@@ _
@@how often do we need to calculate big numbers by hand like we were trained in high school?@@ _
@@do we even write with a pen any longer?@@ '

@@moreover, when the jobs are considerably less than the working age population, fierce competition occurs, which is scarcely regulated.@@ _
@@when 100 people are competing for 50 positions, lamentably, no matter how good they are, there will always be 50 people who leave unemployed; they remain in the labor market, spending more effort on exams and interviews, resulting in an invisible loss in production, in addition to their stress and affliction.@@ _
@@when a student invests another year in preparing exams for medical doctors, another possible human resource stands idle for another year.@@ _
@@everyone settling for an underpaying job is also potentially wasting the opportunity cost.@@ '

@@the younger generation is facing a suffocating absurdity.@@ _
@@not only is a degree borderline irrelevant except in ruling out job applicants,@@
@@but an outstanding performance as a student still does not guarantee jobs.@@ _
@@rather, the digital generation needs qualities other than calculation or memorization, such as curiosity, aspiration, individuality, or cordiality— which are unlikely to be tested nor taught in a pen and paper.@@ '

@@a framed diploma can be reassuring,@@
@@but the depressing fact is that the education system fails in preparing and ensuring jobs.@@ _
@@how do we do that then?@@ _
@@should we instead rely on computer programs to hire people?@@ _
@@or should we draw lots, which at least save some time and energy?@@ _
@@I have no idea.@@ _
@@it is hard for me to imagine anything other than a deep disillusionment in education and a resulting instability of the social hierarchy.@@ _
@@maybe only then can we reshape our dysfunctional labor market.@@ '
