@@but in a broader perspective, these calculations are some simple algorithms in disguise.@@ _
@@operations on a field, changing basis for a matrix, Euclid algorithm on a polynomial ring, and so on— we #know <that they are straightforward, if tedious, to program from scratch, since they are merely a bunch of rigid rules>.@@ _
@@geometric auxiliary lines are a nightmare to guess,@@
@@but they can be determined on a ring with Gröbner basis.@@ _
@@trigonometry identities are &said to be a torture,@@
