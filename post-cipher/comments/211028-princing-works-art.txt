@@what about paintings?@@ _
@@to write this note, I @took a look at some of the most expensive paintings on Wikipedia.@@ _
@@for example, I #find it hard to justify <that «Salvator Mundi» by Leonardo da Vinci (450 300 000 USD) is several times more expensive than «Irises» by Vincent van Gogh (53 900 000 USD)>.@@ _
@@what $does it mean to say the price of «Salvator Mundi» is (considering inflation) some 4 times that of «Irises»?@@ _
@@nor is there an absolute reason <that those paintings by van Gogh in a similar style are all so much cheaper than «Irises»>.@@ '

@@to sort out the mystery, let us continue the analogy in music.@@ _
@@in my view, «Ballade No 1» is a greater work than «Mariage d’amour»,@@
@@but the costs to listen respectively to them $doesn’t evidently differ.@@ _
@@a ticket price for a popular piano concert and one for a classical piano concert are in the same order of magnitude.@@ _
@@on Spotify you can listen to both,@@
@@and listening on YouTube is virtually free.@@ _
@@obviously, when «Ballade No 1» is &played at a concert, the ticket price isn’t some million dollars.@@ _
@@the price of music, more or less, $reflects the cost of physical transmission, rather than its artistic value, {which people are free to judge}.@@ '

@@where does the confusion lie?@@ _
@@there is a crucial difference between the cases of painting and music, namely <that a painting is &confined at a point of space and time>;@@
@@on the contrary, music, drama, poetry, and other forms of art aren’t.@@ _
@@there is only one true physical realization {which is «Irises»},@@
@@but there can be potentially infinitely many recordings of «Ballade no 1», or performances of «Antigone», or printed copies of «War and Peace».@@ _
@@if economic principles are valid here, then the more supply there is, the less the equilibrium price.@@ _
@@thus a painting is hardly regulated by the supply curve,@@
@@but other art forms are.@@ '

@@to complicate the matter, the pricing of physical works of visual art, I #guess, is due much to the monopoly of industry.@@ _
@@paintings #become Giffen goods, {which more people #demand even when their prices #rise}.@@ _
@@they are a means for rich people to show off, to invest in, or even to do the money laundry.@@ _
@@critics, dealers, and collectors #collaborate to hype the price, thus ensuring the value of their possessions.@@ '

@@to break down the vile system, our hope $lies in Google Arts and other digital exhibitions, {which #overthrow the above premise <that a painting $has only one realization>}.@@ _
