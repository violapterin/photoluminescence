@@there is the long held notion that truly substantial creation in mathematics can only be done by young people.@@ _
@@this, for brevity, let us call the “juvenile thesis”.@@ _
@@the view is most famously &expressed in «Apology of a Mathematician» by Hardy, {where he @wrote, “No mathematician should ever allow himself to forget that mathematics, more than any other art or science, is a young man’s game.”}@@ _
@@in addition, the play «Proof» (and its film adaptation), {which I value highly}, $connects mathematics genius not only to the young age, but also to madness, strengthening the perception of the general public.@@ '

@@out of curiosity I @attempted to look up relevant studies supporting and opposing the “juvenile thesis”.@@ _
@@it $appears <there are few decisive quantitative researches>,@@
@@and the question $does look too broad to settle.@@ _
@@I am not able to write a survey,@@
@@but I can share my guess in possible underlying reasons.@@ '

@@obviously mathematics requires concentration, memory, association, and more,@@
@@and hence they definitely #have something to do with physical health, {which $declines gradually with age}.@@ _
@@but the “juvenile thesis” seems to have mistaken quantity with quality.@@ _
@@that is to say, people #put it the way <that once you are past 40 you are &doomed, and you are never %going to do any decent research ever.@@ _
@@this is absurd:@@
@@the journey of life isn’t a step function.@@ _
@@if some calculation takes a 20- year- old 5 minute, it might take a 60- year- old 15 minute,@@
@@but the 60- year- old can still do it, once his or her mental faculty is intact.@@ _
@@the same, I believe, can be said of other creative professions.@@ '

@@or it may just be <that middle aged people #have more obligations than young people #have>,@@
@@and these #distract them from their research.@@ _
@@until the recent change in social norm, only men, not women, were &allowed to pursue an academic career.@@ _
@@without saying, female mathematicians like Sofya Kovalevskaya and Emmy Noether obviously @underwent lots of pressure.@@ _
@@(the reader may want to read ‹Too Much Happiness› by Alice Munro for Kovalevskaya’s story.)@@ _
@@moreover, men were &thought to be responsible for family income.@@ _
@@male mathematicians {who @didn’t made progress in their research for some time}, may be forced to turn to something more profitable.@@ _
@@therefore, both women and men in their middle age had &been under immense social pressure {that @discouraged them from undertaking creative work without much compensation, like mathematics}.@@ _
@@this further $agrees the impression (as Hardy would have said) <that young people are more willing to take risks by considering difficult fields of research>.@@ _
@@furthermore, full time professors are sometimes &occupied with administrative tasks and teaching, making it more daunting to attack tough problems.@@ '

@@so this is my take on the “juvenile thesis”.@@ _
@@the old age may somehow reduce creativity, but only quantitatively rather than qualitatively.@@ _
@@social and family obligations too may be a distraction, if not a restriction.@@ _
@@we should keep in mind, though, <that youthful vigor won’t forever be with us, and every day should be spent wisely>.@@ '
