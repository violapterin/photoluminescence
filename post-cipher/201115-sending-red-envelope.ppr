@@our protagonist have this series of (objectively boring) events happening today, as follows.@@ _
@@somehow, they nevertheless made him happy.@@ '

@@a first friend of his, Mr Jiang the hacker, was getting married; he was a classmate of mine in the EE department, and @worked in Google now.@@ _
@@he was not %willing to attend the wedding banquet, because he is afraid of all the small talks on my future plan.@@ _
@@but the first message {he @received today} saved him;@@ _
@@a second friend of mine, Tina the erhu instructor, @asked him <whether he wanted to go to a concert for free in place of her>, because she could not go.@@ _
@@she had to attend an awards ceremony.@@ '

@@he nevertheless @wanted to send the “red envelope”, {that is money gift}, to Mr Jiang;@@ _
@@he checked the internet, and counted 2 800, more than serviceable considering they are not close.@@ _
@@thus, he @handed the envelope physically and left, going to the concert.@@ _
@@then, it @occurred to him in the concert, he forgot to mark on the envelope <that it was indeed for Mr Jiang, the groom>,@@ _
@@and the receptionist would not tell.@@ _
@@would he get the money? he was so poorly @versed in social conventions that he often chose to be alone.@@ '

@@it was a premiere concert of newly commissioned pieces in Chinese style.@@ _
@@composers stood up to receive applause after their pieces were performed.@@ _
@@it struck him another time, seeing this, that he always had wanted to be a composer, an amateur one, yet he lacked the talent and time.@@ _
@@he had sometimes pictured that he shall work during the day and compose music at night.@@ _
@@and the vision looked so distant and vague, he thought, in the blackness in the concert hall, in front of the spotlight.@@ '

@@the concert ended, and Tina messaged him whether he enjoyed it.@@ _
@@“I prefer a more modern style.” he wrote.@@ '

@@“Have you been composing music lately?” she asked.@@ _
@@(he acquainted her only once at a recital of another common friend of ours, where he said he sometimes compose music.)@@ '

@@“Haven’t for some time.@@ _
@@will you help me if he write an erhu piece?”@@ _
@@he asked.@@ '

@@sure, she replied, showing genuine interest.@@ _
@@immediately she sent him a file {which explained the erhu’s ability}.@@ _
@@this @cheered him up, so much that he was immediately in a whimsical mood, imagining erhu melodies in my head.@@ '

@@several years ago, he recalled, he said to a third friend of mine, Melania the flautist, that he would write a flute sonata and ask her to try it out.@@ _
@@she was studying in Paris.@@ _
@@months ago, intending to bring up the matter, he wrote some melodies and @messaged them to her, and she didn’t reply.@@ '

@@then, Mr Jiang @messaged him to thank him for my envelope.@@ _
@@“I will perhaps ask you, some time, how it is like to work at Google.” he wrote.@@ _
@@anytime, he wrote.@@ '

@@later, a fourth friend of hime, Cassandra the pianist, @messaged him, remarking that she was %getting married (too), and @invited him to watch the live stream on YouTube, and Melania, our common friend, was also invited.@@ _
@@amused, he @messaged Melania, mentioning the flute sonata.@@ _
@@she @replied instantly, to his surprise, urging him to complete the piece.@@ _
@@he @wished to dedicate the piece to her, he wrote, if it would indeed be done.@@ _
@@it will be an honor, she wrote, and she had found a piano accompanist.@@ '

@@this was how the protagonist, somehow, @reconnected four friends, within one day.@@ _
@@these were trivial matters, and they made him laugh, in the same way you earnestly believe a flaw to be grave but it may very well be immaterial, or an air to be serious, but be lighthearted, as when a cook gave you eleven meatballs instead of ten, or a stapler @failed to penetrate the last page.@@ _
@@it was like this he was having this unfounded epiphany on the street, in the rush hour in the evening, in a warm wintry breeze.@@ _
@@things, at least some of the times, are going to be okay.@@ _
@@it is a common shortfall of ours to forget happy times when we are sad, which we nevertheless must try — as sad times when happy.@@ '
