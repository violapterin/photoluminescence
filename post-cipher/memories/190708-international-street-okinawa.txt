@@the first time I @travel in some 4 years, in fact the first time I @travel alone, I was %going to Okinawa for a short 4-day vacation.@@ _
@@impressed by the MRT Airport Line, and pleased by the simplified boarding procedure of Eva Air, it @took a little more than 1 hour from Taoyuan to Naha.@@ _
@@given the Kanji obvious in meaning, it was more straightforward to figure out how to transfer by local monorail to the Miebashi Station [美 栄 橋 駅] close to {where I was to dwell for 3 nights}.@@ _
@@along the neatly arranged blocks and traffic lights, I was able to get to the hotel, by following Google Maps (thanks to the affordable roaming plan of mobile company Docomo, about 300 NTD each day in price).@@ _
@@the Smile Hotel Okinawa {where I was %staying}, marked 3- star on Google, was tidy and &equipped with most necessities,@@
@@but it only @cost about 2 000 NTD every night.@@ _

@@from my hotel I returned to Miebashi Station to meet my friend Fangyi; it was a 20-minute walk.@@ _
@@the street was full of Izakaya- bars and Yakiniku- grill restaurants, and of chained retail stores— the most pervasive is “Lawson”— still open late, including the familiar FamilyMart.@@ _
@@by 9— it was nominally 1 hour later than Taipei here— I saw Fangyi by the Station.@@ _
@@she came to Okinawa too, together with another friend of ours, Peiling.@@ _

@@though staying in Okinawa in the same interval, we were only to meet tonight.@@ _
@@to elaborate, they first @invited me to come with them,@@
@@but they @regretted.@@ _
@@I appeared irritated,@@
@@and later I @asked their pardon for my attitude.@@ _
@@in return, Fangyi @said <she and I could had a dinner the first day>.@@ _
@@meanwhile, Peiling @had to work to meet the deadline on the long- planned vacation.@@ _
@@let us bless her and refrain from disturbing her.@@ _

@@instead let us note <that, in front of us, the first place of interest as of today— but not for Fangyi, a seasoned traveler of Japan— The International Street [国 際 通 り], {where along the direction of radiant lights of shop signs, @lay a variety of shops and restaurants}.@@ _

@@the very first eye- catching product was the glassware, a feature in Okinawa.@@ _
@@I purchased a spiral- curved glass cup in an attractive dark blue, resembling, and named after, the Blue Cave [青 の 洞 窟] ({where I was not going to, since it was too cumbersome to swim or snorkel alone}).@@ _
@@besides food, cosmetic shops were also &said to be a must visit, for your information.@@ _

@@there were masks made of volcano dust, shampoo containing honey, Merlion- like lion figurines, and the peculiar sea grapes [海 ぶ ど う] crunchy and rather salty in taste.@@ _
@@what I @did bought was cheap packs of dried seaweed, cured fish, and the chilies dipped in wine (though they were to be stopped in custom later).@@ _
@@I also @bought a case of Sablé cookie made with the featured salt of Chitan [北 谷], to treat fellow Lab students, thus supporting the excuse for my absence.@@ _
@@food @made up the most practical gifts.@@ _

@@Fangyi and I @walked westward along the International Street, and encountered a ramen shop, Koryu [康 竜].@@ _
@@I @ordered a soy- sauce- flavored ramen simply called “Ramen”, coming with rice with raw yolk.@@ _
@@it was, as expected, salty but good.@@ _

@@Fangyi had &been to Germany when she was a child, and @knew Japanese too.@@ _
@@we commented on language learning experiences;@@
@@although I was embarrassed to admit <that I had almost &forgotten anything German I had learnt a few years ago>, and my understanding of Japanese was no more than Duolingo level- one lessons taken days ago.@@ _

@@I @shared a recent enlightenment with her.@@ _
@@in every language, there are so- called “content words” and “function words”.@@ _
@@I @found it instructive to think <that function words add redundancy, analogous to error correction codes>, so <that content words could resist from misreading and mishearing>.@@ _
@@and Japanese was particularly unusual in this regard, since it @adopted two writing systems, Kana and Kanji.@@ _
@@it was no accident, then, <that Kana exhibited inflection in a wider sense, while Kanji could not>.@@ _

@@we @talked a lot, and were in a good mood.@@ _
