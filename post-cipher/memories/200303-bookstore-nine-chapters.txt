@@in February 2020, I @saw on Facebook a post saying <that Nine Chapters [九 章], a mathematics bookstore, was to be closed at the end of 2020>,@@
@@and <that they were %having a clearance sale>.@@ _
@@the post was &written by the shop owner, Mr Wenxian Sun [孫 文 先] himself.@@ '

@@on March 3, fearing good books would soon get sold out, I @visited Nine Chapters, years later since the last time.@@ _
@@recognizing the plaque in calligraphic style, I @pushed the glass door, {which @struck the wind chime}, and @entered the once- familiar room with shorter shelves in the center and taller shelves in the surroundings.@@ _
@@on top of the shorter shelves were various puzzles, games, and models, including the Rush Hour, the Soma cube, the Tower of Hanoi, and wooden polyhedra, {many of which I @owned when I was a kid}, as if my childhood memories were some donated organs, taken out and being dissected on an operation table.@@ '

@@when I was in elementary school, I was a quiet boy.@@ _
@@when my classmates played basketball at recess, I @avoided them by reading at my seat.@@ _
@@when my classmates @talked about «Naruto» or «Slam Dunk», I didn’t even know where to borrow comic books.@@ _
@@one day the instructor @asked us to take a favorite book to share with classmates,@@
@@and I @took an album of Maurits Escher’s engravings, and @sat attentively like a dutiful guide in a museum, waiting for anyone {who @appreciated for a second the marvel of hyperbolic tiles}.@@ '

@@when I was in the second grade— {at which time Taiwan saw a flurry of popular science publications}— Father @bought me translations of «Mathematics: The Man-made Universe» by Sherman Stein, «Trigonometric Delights» by Eli Maor, and «In Code» by Sarah Flannery, among others.@@ _
@@I @kept reading and pestering him to buy me more of them, such as «Mathematical Sorcery» by Calvin Clawson and «How to Ace Calculus» by Colin Adams and others.@@ '

@@then, when I was in the eighth grade, after finishing an introduction to Euclid’s «Elements», I @resolved to read «Elements» itself, {of which Nine Chapters had &published a translation}.@@ _
@@the translation wasn’t found at downtown bookstores,@@
@@and Father @accompanied me to Nine Chapters to purchase.@@ _
@@I @read the «Elements» within some 3 months, {which I @remarked on the copyright page}.@@ '

@@Nine Chapters’s puzzles soon @attracted me, so much that {I almost @thought <that all {that mathematics was}, was a long series of puzzles>}.@@ _
@@I @fashioned a Soma cube with clay according to an article of Martin Gardner’s, and @constructed a slide rule copied from a plan in «Scientific American».@@ _
@@I @liked to study the Lonpos pyramid [龍 博 士 魔 術 金 字 塔] and the Rush Hour,@@
@@and I @built molecule models from magnetic balls and sticks.@@ _
@@(once I lost a ball,@@
@@and Father @intended to purchase another set for me,@@
@@but Mr Sun @gave him just one ball for free.)@@ _
@@eventually, Mr Sun must have remembered us, {who @visited so often},@@
@@and he sometimes @gave us discounts.@@ '

@@in the ninth grade, I @spent little time preparing for the Basic Competence Test [基 本 學 力 測 驗], {which wasn’t difficult for me at all}.@@ _
@@I would rather read Nine Chapters’s expositions on advanced mathematics.@@ _
@@I @forced myself to read several pages a day on Gödel incompleteness theorem and Fermat last theorem, though I #doubt <how much I really @understood by then about recursive functions or elliptic curves>.@@ _
@@I was also &fascinated by the software Super Sketchbook [超 級 畫 板], {which @made use of Gröbner basis in a polynomial ideal to decide geometrical propositions}, a fact {I @learnt many years later}.@@ '

@@mathematics is some precious certainty {that $provides good company for me}.@@ _
@@it is an amusement park built exclusively for me.@@ _
@@I #know <when the recorded scream is to be played in the haunted mansion>,@@
@@and I am %going to enter again.@@ _

@@mr Sun and his wife @established in 1978 Bookstore Nine Chapters, named after a nine- chapter mathematical treatise in the Han dynasty, since he @found educational materials on mathematics to be lacking.@@ _
@@by then, Taiwan and Mainland China had &made temporary peace,@@
@@but the Cold War hadn’t &ended;@@
@@Mr Sun @grasped the opportunity of introducing books from the other side of the strait (especially Simplified Chinese translations of Russian books in the Soviet Union), and @typeset those in Simplified Chinese again in Traditional Chinese.@@ _
@@in their prime, many dissertations of top university students @used to be formatted by Nine Chapters.@@ '

@@their book covers #look so shabby, I #suspect <they are &done by Microsoft Paint>.@@ _
@@if you #inspect closely enough, you will find traces of manual typesetting:@@
@@the letters aren’t perfectly &aligned,@@
@@and some strokes are fainter;@@
@@they must have &cut and &glued paper scraps on the master copy.@@ _
@@what’s worse, equations are &riddled with typos, {which can confuse me for hours}.@@ _
@@however, they #don’t have time to fix all of that,@@
@@but they will scan their older publications and release the electronic files for free>.@@ '

@@TeX and LaTeX @matured in the 1990s,@@
@@and digital typesetting of mathematics has gradually &become the norm.@@ _
@@moreover, books from China can nowadays be shipped to Taiwan with one click,@@

@@today, I @had a hard time finding any book worth buying.@@ _
@@olympiad problems, classical geometry, and solitaire board games, they no longer @seemed important anymore.@@ _
@@I had @learnt analysis, statistics, and algebra, not too much but enough to take them lightly.@@ '

@@yet there are grown- ups {who #don’t even consider analysis, statistics, and algebra to be important, except of their cars, houses, and children}.@@ _
@@and maybe they will end up being correct.@@ _
@@or maybe we will get old enough to realize <that nothing $matters whatsoever>.@@ _
@@everything is a puzzle {we #play to feel being here}.@@ _
@@I #wonder {which is more %devastating}: finding something {you once @cherished} to appear foolish, or knowing something {you now #cherish} will appear foolish.@@ '

@@I @picked «First- Order Logic» by Raymond Smullyan, «A Modern View of Geometry» by Leonard Blumenthal, and a guide on Olympiad inequalities.@@ _
@@I wasn’t sure <why I needed those>;@@
@@I just @wanted to pay for something.@@ '

@@Mr Sun @asked me by the cashier, “You really #don’t want the Chinese translation of Olympiad inequalities, {which is so much cheaper}?”@@ '

@@“um, no, thanks.”@@ '

@@“well, if you #say so.@@ _
@@strangely, I can’t find the record of the price.@@ _
@@how much is the Olympiad inequalities?” He called his wife.@@ _
@@“whatever.@@ _

@@I @didn’t come to Nine Chapters again,@@
@@and I @visualized the place being remodeled to a shoe store or a Boba tea stand, {which might make me sentimental on seeing it}.@@ '

@@however, another one and half year later, I @heard recently <that Nine Chapters was still open>, because several loyal customers @appealed Mr Sun not to close it.@@ _
@@I @told myself <that I should check it out>,@@
