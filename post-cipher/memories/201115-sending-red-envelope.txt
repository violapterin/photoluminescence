@@our protagonist $has this series of (objectively boring) events happening today, as follows.@@ _
@@they nevertheless @made him happy,@@
@@but he wasn’t sure why.@@ '

@@a first friend of his, Mr Jiang the hacker, was getting married;@@
@@they were both in the electrical engineering department under advisor Prof Bingcheng,@@
@@and Mr Jiang @worked in Google now.@@ _
@@he wasn’t in the mood of attending the wedding banquet, because he was afraid of all the small talks on his future plan.@@ _
@@but the first message {he @received today} saved him;@@
@@a second friend of mine, Tina the erhu player, @asked him <whether he @wanted to go to a concert for free in place of her>, since she couldn’t go:@@
@@she @had to attend an awards ceremony.@@ '

@@he nevertheless @wanted to send the “red envelope”, or money gift, to Mr Jiang;@@
@@he @checked on the internet {how much it should be}, and counted bills to an amount more than serviceable considering they weren’t close.@@ '
@@he @handed the envelope physically on the table and @left, heading to the concert.@@ _
@@then it @occurred to him, in the concert, <he @forgot to mark on the envelope <that it was indeed for Mr Jiang, the groom>>,@@
@@and the receptionist wouldn’t tell.@@ _
@@would he get the money?@@ _
@@he was so poorly- @versed in social conventions <that he often @chose to be alone>.@@ '

@@it was a premiere concert of newly commissioned pieces in Chinese style.@@ _
@@composers @stood up to receive applause after their pieces were &performed.@@ _
@@it @struck him another time, seeing this, <that he always had &wanted to be a composer, an amateur one>,@@
@@yet he @lacked the talent and time>.@@ _
@@he had sometimes &pictured <that he would work during the day and compose music at night>.@@ _
@@and the vision @seemed so distant and vague to him, in the darkness in the concert hall, in front of the spotlight.@@ '

@@the concert @ended,@@
@@and Tina @messaged him <whether he @enjoyed it>.@@ _
@@“I #prefer a more modern style than a strictly pentatonic one.” he @wrote.@@ '

@@“have you &been composing music lately?” she asked.@@ _
@@(he acquainted her only once at a recital by Dengkai, another common friend of theirs, {where he @said he sometimes compose music}.)@@ '

@@“#haven’t for some time.@@ _
@@will you help me if I write an erhu piece?”@@ _
@@he asked.@@ '

@@sure, she @replied, showing genuine interest.@@ _
@@immediately she @sent him a file {which explained the ability of the erhu}.@@ _
@@this @cheered him up, so much <that he was immediately in a whimsical mood, imagining erhu melodies in his head>.@@ '

@@several years ago, he was &reminded, he @said to a third friend of his, Melanie the flautist, <that he would write a flute sonata and ask her to try it out>.@@ _
@@she was now &studying in Paris.@@ _
@@months ago, intending to bring up the matter, he wrote some melodies and @messaged them to her,@@
@@and she didn’t reply.@@ '

@@then, Mr Jiang @messaged him to thank him for my envelope.@@ _
@@“I will perhaps ask you, some time, how it is like to work at Google.” he @wrote.@@ _
@@anytime, he @replied.@@ '

@@later, a fourth friend of his, Cassandra the pianist, @messaged him, remarking <that she was %getting married (too)>, and @invited him to watch the live stream on Twitch, on which Melanie, their common friend, was also &invited.@@ _
@@amused, he @messaged Melanie, mentioning the flute sonata.@@ _
@@she @replied instantly, to his surprise, urging him to complete the piece.@@ _
@@he @wished to dedicate the piece to her, he @wrote, if it would indeed be done.@@ _
@@it would be an honor, she @wrote, and she had &found a piano accompanist.@@ '

@@this was <how the protagonist, somehow, @reconnected four friends, within one day>.@@ _
@@these were trivial matters,@@
@@and they @made him laugh, in the same way {you earnestly @believed a flaw to be grave but it might very well be immaterial, or an air to be serious, but be lighthearted}, as when a cook in IKEA @gave you eleven meatballs instead of ten, or a stapler @failed to penetrate the last page.@@ _
@@it was like this {that he was %having this unfounded epiphany on the street, in the rush hour in the evening, in a warm wintry breeze}.@@ _
@@things, at least some of the times, were %going to be okay.@@ _
@@it was a common shortfall of ours to forget happy times when we were sad, {which we nevertheless must try}— as sad times when happy.@@ '
