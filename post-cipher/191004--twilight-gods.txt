@@this was the first time {I @entered this lofty modernistic building having opened about precisely 3 years ago}.@@ _
@@one @walked in the middle of huge curved pillars, and @came up several set of stairs to get to the big hall where the performance was to take place.@@ _
@@there were other smaller- sized halls.@@ _
@@there, a large orchestra pit could be accommodated, {which National Concert Hall couldn’t do}.@@ _
@@before the performance, I @attended a helpful listening guide starting at about 16:00 in the medium hall, presented by Daiwei Lü [呂 岱 衛].@@ _
@@we were &given free brochures, {which @summarized the plot and leitmotifs (without score examples)}.@@ '

@@act 1 @lasted from 17:15 to 19:10, Act 2 from 19:45 to 20:45, Act 3 from 21:10 to 22:30.@@ _
@@in the two long intermissions, stands were %selling absurdly expensive light food,@@
@@but hungry people still @bought that, including me.@@ _
@@when it @ended, I @feared <that I couldn’t catch the train back to Taipei>.@@ _
@@but I @managed to stay for another 10 minutes to give stand ovation, {which was more important}.@@ _
@@then I @took a taxi, and @caught the very last train, making perfect use of every minute.@@ '

@@previously, I kind of @thought Wagner to be dry, even hypnotic.@@ _
@@while this Spanish team had &collaborated with National Taichung Theater for 4 years in a row, this time I @decided to give the last one in the franchise a try.@@
@@I @wondered <what a full- fledged production of the «Ring» would be like>,@@
@@and the «Ring» wasn’t commonly &performed in entirety.@@ _
@@and I @didn’t regret it at all!@@ _
@@Wagner was &meant to be watched after all.@@ '

@@with the 3 000 NTD ticket, I was &seated at the point one- third- the- width to the right wall, and one- third- the- depth to the back wall, close enough to see their facial expression.@@ _
@@the acoustic experience was really great.@@ _
@@the orchestra @played smoothly,@@
@@and I couldn’t identify any mistake.@@ _
@@tubas, timpani, and double bassoons were particularly grandiose to hear in real time.@@ _

@@the singers were impressive too.@@ _
@@apart from daunting register and sheer volume {that Wagner demands}, the roles of Siegfried and Brünnhilde @called for a youthful vividness.@@ _
@@in particular, Siegfried’s part was challenging;@@
@@there were passages marked piano but involving notes as high as@@ ++a'++ @@},@@
@@and his highest note was@@ ++c''++ @@!@@ _
@@when he was %dying– kneeling and lying face- down on the floor and calling Brünnhilde– Siegfried’s player @sang as effortlessly as before.@@ _
@@Hagen’s player @had a particularly sonorous voice, being somehow coarse but not displeasingly so, {which strangely @suited the sinister character}.@@ _
@@though the voices of Siegfried and Brünnhilde’s players were able to compete with the orchestra, the resounding voice of Hagen’s was particularly %overwhelming.@@ '
@@meanwhile, the singers’ interpretation @appeared to be more controlled than liberal, perhaps because I was too &accustomed to recordings.@@ '
===

===
@@on the other hand, the stage and costume design were eccentric.@@ _
@@the costume was in the style of science fiction.@@ _
@@that apart, there were more strange symbolisms all over the place, like numbers in Chinese characters, and a@@ ^^$p^^ @@as big as his chest printed on the back of Gunther’s coat.@@ _
@@(I @didn’t expect LaTeX to come in handy in this music review.)@@ _
@@everybody was in western suits, except for the quasi- primitive outfit Siegfried wore in the beginning.@@ '

@@most of the time, the stage was free of props,@@
@@and the surroundings were &hinted only by projected images.@@ _
@@the minimalism certainly wasn’t <what Wagner had &expected>, considering <that the composer @built a cutting- edge theater to host his lavish production>.@@ _
@@the minimalism could be too much, for example in the very last dramatic event, {where Hagen should have been devoured into the Rhine}.@@ _
@@this wasn’t &shown literally, but instead Hagen @rode on a electronic unicycle and @fell onto the ground.@@ _
@@(it was difficult to tell <what was happening> in the midst of a swarm of acrobats.)@@ '

@@there were some acrobat performances, {which wasn’t a bad thing}, but such endeavor wasn’t &integrated smoothly to the story.@@ _
@@in end of Act 1, the performers in skin- colored bodysuit, possibly suggesting they were naked, @wiggled on the rock {on which Brünnhilde @resided}, when Siegfried, disguised as Gunther, @swore by the sword <that he wouldn’t touch Brünnhilde>.@@ _
@@then in the end of Act 2, the performers @made virtuoso jumps in the realm of gods.@@ _
@@and in the end of Act 3, the performers, hung like flying trapeze, again impressively @circled around Siegfried’s dead body, {which was supposedly the building of Valhalla}.@@ _
@@(it might be due to ease of arrangement, <that they always @introduced acrobats in the concluding section only>.)@@ _
@@I wasn’t sure about <what these acrobat sections @signified>.@@ _
@@nevertheless, they @did make good use of the vertical visual room of the spacious hall.@@ '

@@in addition to acrobats, the director was %trying very hard to prevent audiences from sleeping, by projecting animation on the screen, when instrumental interludes were %playing.@@ _
@@it @showed, for instance, in Act 2 the sea {Siegfried was %sailing in}, when he @went on his adventures.@@ _
@@but animation could be a tad ludicrous, considering the serious nature of the drama.@@ '

===
@@the plot of the whole «Ring» cycle is mostly well- thought- out.@@ _
@@interlocking action, out of love and hatred, loyalty and betrayal, $makes characters well-rounded and sophisticated.@@ _
@@introduction of physical devices, like the ring and the helmet, often $foreshadows later development.@@ _
@@it is so heart- %wrenching <that, if any character had &thrown the ominous ring away, they would have avoided their doom>,@@
@@and even the fearless Sigfried couldn’t overcome his fate.@@ '

@@admittedly, there are some inconsistency in the plot.@@ _
@@to take an example, in the end of Act 2, surely Gunter $doesn’t know the fact <that Brünnhilde has been &united with Siegfried>.@@ _
@@but when Brünnhilde $says <that there is a vulnerable spot on Siegfried’s back>, $doesn’t Gunter suspect <that there is something between them>?@@ _
@@as another instance, why is Siegfried just about to come to the Gibichungs’ castle, the moment Hagen, Gunther, and Gutrune there $finishes the discussion of their evil plan?@@ _
@@(such problems might also be due to the limitation of scene transition.)@@ _
===

===
@@speaking of Wagner’s music, the heart of his success, or failure, is his use of leitmotifs.@@ _
@@in its best, the effect is remarkably %satisfying.@@ _
@@as Siegfried $recounts his adventure, previous leitmotifs #appear, corresponding to the topic, all constructed tightly and organically.@@ _
@@when Brünnhilde $jumps into the flames to her death, a series of interwoven leitmotifs eloquently $summarizes the whole franchise, suggesting the theme of destruction and redemption.@@ '

@@then how can Wagner still $appears abstruse to many?@@ _
@@it may have something to do, I guess, with his melodies, {which usually lacks distinctive contour}.@@ _
@@they #follow leitmotifs rather faithfully,@@
@@and they aren’t &changed and &developed as much as <what Beethoven often does>.@@ _
@@having went to the opera, I #remember very little of the melody,@@
@@but the ever- repeating leitmotifs are hard to forget, even irritating.@@ '

@@also, Wagner seldom $writes heavy contrapuntal lines, nor $introduces complicated rhythms.@@ _
@@most sections #feature a single voice, as if the singers are just another instrument,@@
@@and I would appreciate if he had &written more duets and trios.@@ _
@@(the argument between Gunter, Brünnhilde, and Hagen in the end of Act 2, is one of the scarce examples of a trio.)@@ '

@@sometimes Wagner $uses higher chords and their rarer variations, like the half-diminished ninth@@ ++{C; A; F; D} / B++ @@,@@ @@{where the minor ninth is really clashing}.@@ _
@@but apart from such peculiarities, he $keeps a fairly classical vocabulary, {which can sound incongruous}.@@ '
===

===
@@Wagner still isn’t one of my favorite composers;@@
@@to me, the leitmotif thing $doesn’t quite work out.@@ _
@@but I #recognize his effort and #praise his ingenuity,@@
@@and I #do replay other «Ring» albums on Spotify from time to time.@@ _
@@perhaps some day my liking for him will grow, perhaps not.@@ '
