@@in Jasons Market Place, where I passed by on the road home, several chunks of Selles- sur- Cher cheese seemed to have a hard time getting sold, as they have lain on the shelf for days.@@ _
@@i didn’t blame people for not buying such exotic food, which has on its surface such sinister dark blue wrinkles resembling gyri in a brain.@@ _
@@out of rebellion, I bought a piece of Selles- sur- Cher cheese, and tried.@@ _
@@and I didn't like it.@@ _
@@even stronger than blue cheese, the poignant smell and taste, curiously appealing and appalling at the same time, is too much to be swallowed with a big bite, even with a good mouthful of red wine.@@ '

@@when I was a kid, I used to wonder why these cheeses with mold were edible.@@ _
@@but they turned out to be so good;@@
@@they are the prime example of something atrocious in appearance but kind in the heart.@@ _
@@then it occurred to me that mushrooms are edible, which we are accustomed to, and both mushrooms and molds are fungi.@@ '

@@what happened to the first people who tasted blue cheese? For those brave enough to do it, good for them;@@
@@at least I wouldn’t, if nobody told me that the hairy, smelly thing was safe.@@ _
@@indeed, such a habit might as well have led to food poisoning, had they picked molds toxic to humans.@@ _
@@quite plausibly, those who survived told the elders of the information, and others just died.@@ _
@@every time we have a bite, let us for a second mourn for those nameless martyrs who paid with their lives for trying out new kinds of mold.@@ '

@@but those who tried blue cheese were lucky.@@ _
@@penicillium chrysogenum is not toxic;@@
@@even better, it came to be the source of penicillin, the first antibiotics, which saved numerous soldiers’ lives in the Second World War.@@ _
@@species of penicillium produce mycotoxins, which kill bacteria and other kinds of fungi.@@ _
@@this is why those cheeses with mold, along with stinky tofu and fermented fish, last so much longer.@@ '

@@fungi not only protect themselves, but form a network too, which can detect and cooperate, as if having its own senses.@@ _
@@in the documentary «Fantastic Fungi», we can distinctly see, in the time-lapse filming, the body of a mouse enclosed by hyphae until only its hair remains, or the growing mushroom swaying erratically from the weight of its cap.@@ _
@@i wonder what they really are, these destructors and constructors, friends and fiends.@@ _
@@these fungi expand on an orange like thunderclouds eager to take control of the land, until bolts and bolts of thunder, ominous and menacing, pierce through the earth to suck out all its energy.@@ '

@@the use of psychedelics, in addition, has a long history in primordial cultures, and I suspect it contributes to the advent of most ostensible religious experiences, and hence those religions itself.@@ _
@@what I did not know is that many bans of psychedelics are pretty recent, about when its usage surged in the 1960s, the age of hippies.@@ _
@@presently, some experts are instead advocating the benefits of psychedelics in treating psychological diseases, such as trauma and depression, if used moderately.@@ '

@@those who took psychedelics in the treatment described the feeling to be powerful, joyful, and peaceful, just as spiritual experiences are said to be.@@ _
@@the humanoid psychic images, the wobbling contours, and kaleidoscope of shapes, and other transcendental, ineffable forms they somehow had contact with: is it the very altered state of consciousness experienced by a meditating Buddhist monk or a praying Christian nuns? Or better, is it what is called love?@@ _
@@Is it like the moment, I imagine, we have when the first note a pianist plays resonates in a majestic hall, freezing the air and stopping the time, or when, tired of talking, guests at a table all get quiet incidentally, silent but content, still but wishful?@@ '

@@whatever that is, I wish I knew, but I don’t.@@ _
@@it is not the real world I recognize.@@ _
@@as far as I see, the world is more infinite nausea and vice, than is infinite beauty and love, which I am not meant to know, not as those who open their arms and close their eyes to become the unity, ironically reminiscent of the fungi endlessly expanding, residing inside us, before us, and after us, continuing the never ending fight between life and death, and the eternal struggle between one and whole.@@ '
