Bookstore Nine Chapters

In March 2020, a Facebook friend shared a post saying that Nine Chapters, a mathematics bookstore, is about to close at the end of 2020, and they are selling the remaining books in the inventory with a discount. Several days later, afraid that they might be sold out soon, I went to Nine Chapters, some six years after the last time.

I came by myself, recognizing the small plaque written in calligraphic style The small place with a desk in the middle, and the makeshift inventory.
there are olympiad books on the shelf, and wooden puzzles: Rush Hour (try to get the red car of the traffic jam)
Baguenaudier is isomorphic to Tower of Hanoi?
Lonpos pyramid makes use of the fact that face center assemble?


When I was in elementary school, I did not know how to make friends.
Father and mother thought video games were bad to my eyes, and I did not know where to borrow comic books.
When I was in the second grade, Father bought me (Chinese translations of) «Mathematics: The Man-made Universe» by Sherman Stein, and «Trigonometric Delights» by Eli Maor, and «In Code» by Sarah Flannery, and «Statistics» by David Moore.
«Radar, Hula Hoops and Playful Pigs»
And I asked him to buy me more every time we visited a bookstore— at which time Taiwan saw a flurry of popular science publication— such as «Mathematical Sorcery» by Calvin Clawson, «How to Ace Calculus» by Colin Adams and others, and 

After I saw a book on Euclid’s «Elements», I resolved to read «Elements» itself.
The translation is not 

I fashioned a Soma cube with clay, and constructed a slide rule from a plan printed in «Scientific American».

I solved the Lonpos pyramid, the Rush Hour, and the magnetic ball-and-stick model of molecules,
The shop owner must have known my parents and me, who visit so often.


My classmates talked of Naruto or Slam Dunk, and I played puzzles on my own.
When they played tag, basketball, or queued in front of the fireman pole in the playground, I would remain reading in my seat.
One day the instructor asked us to take a favorite book, and I took an album of Maurits Escher’s paintings; I sat attentively to wait until anyone, instead of reading mangas, would share for a second the marvel of Escher’s engravings full hyperbolic tiles and stellar polyhedra, like an dutiful guide in a museum.

and the exposition on Gödel incompleteness theorem and Fermat last theorem, when I was in the eighth grade. I forced myself to read several pages a day, but I probably could hardly understand Gödel numbers or elliptic functions.

I was especially obsessed with making paper cranes and polyhedra designed by Tomoko Fuse. Father, thinking it was too dangerous for me to use a paper knife, would cut square papers so I could make paper cranes; for connected cranes, we leave a little bit of paper uncut. Once Father took me to visit a relative, and I insisted on getting home to make paper cranes, so much that we had an argument, and I wept, troubled by the papers not being square nor smooth enough.

Now I know analysis, statistics, and algebra reasonably well, too well to take seriously the Rush Hour or the paper crane.

And the software Super Sketchbook [超 級 畫 板], which uses Gröbner basis to decide geometry propositions, a fact I know years later when taking algebra.
so many typos in the books, even before the advent of TeX.
longer lines of fractions are even drawn by hands.
Equations are often riddled with typos, which I sometimes wonder for hours, and they didn’t have time to revise it right now.
They typed books published from Mainland China in Simplified Chinese, again in Traditional Chinese.


I didn’t check out Nine Chapters afterwards, and I imagine the scene where the building was torn down by a crane.
strangely, recently I heard that it didn’t close.
I said to myself that I ought to come again, but somehow, I am not willing to go either.
Perhaps so that I can continue to picture it being obliterated.


In the debris falling all over the place, the shelves collapse, the polyhedron models are littered on the ground, and the 

a little boy, curling up in the corner, and playing the Rush Hour in who knows how many times.
“What are you doing here?”
“I can’t get the red car out. It’s stuck in a traffic jam!”
“Leave them alone. We have to get out, not the car!”
“But they will get lonely.”
“They don’t. You do. You get lonely sometimes, and you play puzzles, one after another. But playing puzzles never stops you from feeling lonely. So stop that, and come with me.”
“But what about the red car? I must get it out! Help me get it out!”
I crossed my legs to sit down beside him. Above us sands and rocks start to fall.
“One more puzzle, and we get out of this place, alright?”
